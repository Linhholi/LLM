I am planning to build a chatbot dedicated to my favourite show The big bang theory using open-source libraries.

- Step 1: extracting data: using Python and BeautifulSoup to scrap all the scripts on the show (source scripts: https://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/ for season 1 to 10 and Netflix for season 11 and 12) (DONE)
- Step 2: building a chatbot: + privateGPT or localGPT (PROCESSING)
