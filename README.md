I am building a chatbot dedicated to my favourite show The Big Bang Theory using open-source libraries.

- Step 1: extracting data: using Python and BeautifulSoup to scrap all the scripts on the show (source scripts: https://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/ for seasons 1 to 10 and Netflix for seasons 11 and 12) (DONE)
- Step 2: building a chatbot:
    + privateGPT or localGPT
    + streamlit + openAI
