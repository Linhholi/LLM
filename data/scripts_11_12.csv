Sheldon,
to win the Nobel.
But it's not more important
than our friends.
How can you call them friends
when they're abandoning us?
They're abandoning us
because you broke
their hearts.
I didn't mean to.
I know!
You never mean to.
That's the only reason
people tolerate you!
Does that include you?
Sometimes, yeah.

from our sponsor.
Oh, thank you.

Leonard, I can't go home.
I have to be there for Amy.
Yeah.
I was thinking that, too.
As angry as I am at Sheldon,
I still want to see him win
that medal.
It's so strange.
No matter how thoughtless
and selfish he is,
I still love him.

he has kind of been

Wait, what?
Bernie's parents took over.
The kids are fine.
Really?
Oh, poor little guy.
Yeah, it's Stuart.
Is Michael okay?
Bernie's dad gave him a hug,
cracked a rib.
we'll meet you in the lobby.
Yeah. Okay,
How long is it gonna take you
to get ready?
Oh, I just need, like,
five or ten minutes.
Really?
No. What is wrong with you?!

ANNOUNCER:
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler
and Dr. Sheldon Cooper
for their discovery
of super-asymmetry.
(whistling)
(cheers)
(whoops)
(whooping)
Just to be clear,
this isn't a date.
Yeah, I know.
Then why are you
holding my hand?
Thank you, your majesties.
Thank you
to the Nobel Committee.
We are deeply honored.
to take this moment
I would just like
to say to all the young girls
out there
who dream about science
as a profession:
go for it.
It is the greatest job
in the world.
And if anybody tells you
you can't, don't listen.
And now,
speaking of not listening,
my husband,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Sheldon.
What? Did you finish? Great job.
Thank you, Dr. Fowler.
I have a very long
and somewhat self-centered
speech here.
But I'd like to set it aside.
PENNY: Yeah!
Way to go!
WOLOWITZ:
(whoops)
doesn't just belong to me.
Because this honor
I wouldn't be up here
if it weren't
for some very important people
in my life.
Beginning with my mother,
father, meemaw,
brother and sister.
And my other family,
who I'm so happy
to have here with us.
Is that Buffy the
Vampire Slayer?
I was under a misapprehension
that my accomplishments
were mine alone.
Nothing could be further
from the truth.
I have been
encouraged, sustained,
inspired and tolerated
not only by my wife,
of friends anyone ever had.
but by the greatest group
I'd like to ask them to stand.
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.
Rostenkowski Wolowitz.
Dr. Bernadette
Astronaut Howard Wolowitz.
And my two dearest friends
in the world,
Penny Hofstadter...
...and Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
I was there the moment
Leonard and Penny met.
He said to me that their babies
would be smart
and
beautiful.
And now that they're expecting,
that will be the case.
I have no doubt that
Thanks, Sheldon. I-I haven't
told my parents yet, but thanks.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Don't tell anyone
that last thing.
That's a secret.
Howard, Bernadette,
Raj, Penny, Leonard,
been the friend you deserve.
I apologize if I haven't
But I want you to know
in my way,
I love you all.
And I love you.
Thank you.

that someday we'd need them,
have insulted them.
I would never
Oh.
Well, that doesn't
make it better.
Well, it's also not true.
(door opens, closes)
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, that's cute.
Did Halley draw that
at preschool?
I drew it.
Well, good night.
It's supposed to be
an astronaut.
living on my own at this age,
And I'm supposed to be
but here we are.
Halley was scared and Howard
told her the sweetest story
and I thought I could turn it
about when he was in space
into a book for her and Michael.
Oh, well, I mean,
I am an artist.
Uh, i-if you want,
I could do the drawings.
Yeah,
Really? That'd be amazing.
it'd be fun. And a,
from what I usually draw.
a nice change of pace
What do you usually draw?
Well, good night.
(device chimes)
Someone texting you?
Uh, no,
I just met my exercise
goal for the day.
By doing the dishes?
Hey, you have your goals,
I have mine.
What are you two doing?
Hello.
Mm, just finishing a workout.
What's up?
Do you have any cookie dough?
Uh, I think so. Let me see.
Yeah, we've got, uh, chocolate
chip and oatmeal raisin.
Oatmeal raisin?
I know at least two things wrong
with that cookie.
It's for the Nobel Laureates.
but unfortunately, Sheldon...
We need them on our side,
No. ""Unfortunately, Sheldon...""
that's all you got to say.
Well, that's-- so you need
these people's support
and you're sending
them baked goods?
Yeah, they're pretty smart.
Don't you think they're gonna
realize it's just a bribe?
No, you'd think,
but sometimes brilliant people
can be painfully oblivious
to social cues.
Thank you for pointing
that out, Sheldon.
Anytime.
""Sheldon Cooper""? Hmm.
""Sheldon Cooper""?
(scoffs)
Pass.
""Sheldon Cooper."" Aw.
Ugh, oatmeal raisin?
Ugh.
(phone chimes)
Oh, it's from Saul Perlmutter.
He sent me a picture.
(gasps)
Ooh, let me see.
Oh, he arranged the cookies
to spell out ""thank you.""
Sheldon, that word
isn't ""thank.""
Hi. I got you a surprise.
(knock on door)
What-- Oh. (chuckles)
What's the occasion?
that story the other night,
I heard you tell Halley
and I thought it was
so sweet that Stuart and I
turned it into a book.
Little Astronaut?
The Frightened
That looks
just like you.
Look how tiny
and scared you look.
And the best part is,
Stuart showed it
to a publisher
friend of his,
and they're interested in it.
That is so cool.
Absolutely not.
Why?
the whole world to know
Because I don't want
I was the frightened
little astronaut!
Maybe you should've called it
The Bitchy Little Astronaut.
You want to tell me
what's going on?
Is my distress
that obvious?
take this the wrong way,
Sheldon, please don't
but when you're quiet
even for a second,
something's wrong.
Well, it's true.
The fact is, I feel
really bad for Amy.
Well, we all do.
But just for fun,
why do
you?
Well, she didn't
do anything wrong,
but she's paying
for my mistakes.
Wow.
What?
honestly impressed.
No-- I'm just
about other people's feelings?
When did you start caring
Well, I laughed when Amy
got a shock from
lights, so it was after that.
the broken Christmas tree
So none of them are
coming to the reception?
I don't think so.
Okay, what did he say
that was so insulting?
(sighs) Well,
he may have suggested there was
an inelegance to the quadrupole
normalization of Smoot's data.
Damn.
See, sometimes I wish I could
invent a time machine,
so I could go back
and prevent myself
from acting so rashly.
Or moving forward, you could
think before you speak.
I suppose so.
But the time machine thing
is probably more likely.
My problem is that
I don't always know
when I've gone too far.
I could try to help you out.
Well, uh, if you like,
You know, and maybe let you know
if you're crossing a line.
Oh, you mean, like,
with a code word?
Sure.
How's ""shut up""?
That's perfect. People
say it to me all the time,
no one will suspect.
Hey, got a minute?
Sure. What's up?
Uh, Bernadette said
you weren't crazy
about the book.
No. (chuckles)
It's great.
I just don't want anyone
to ever see it
or read it or know it exists.
But this could be
really good for me,
you know? Finally get
my artwork published.
And-and come on,
it's a, it's a cute story.
Oh, easy for
you to say.
No one's gonna think
you're a coward.
Are you kidding?
The other day
a balloon popped and I threw up.
in the comic book store,
take my name off it?
Can't you just
the publisher's interested
No, uh, the only reason
is 'cause a real astronaut
wrote it.
we made a few changes?
Well, look, what if
Uh, sure, yes.
What-what do you have in mind?
Well, nothing major.

But see here on the
what if, I don't know,
""frightened little,""
it didn't say that?
So, it would just be
The Astronaut?
That doesn't quite pop.
Yeah, you're right.
The Brave Astronaut?
What about...
See, that's got
some zip to it!
Okay.
And here on this page,
where I'm crying.
I'm... punching a meteor
What if, instead,
into the sun with
my bare fists?
So you have superpowers?
you're thinking.
I like the way
Professor Thorne?
Dr. Hofstadter.
Uh, you know
my wife, Penny.
Sure. Hi.
PENNY: Hi.
Uh, we wanted to talk to you
about Dr. Cooper.

Now, before you say no...
No.
Well, then, after you say no.
No.
Okay, look, Sheldon's
a pain in the ass.
But Dr. Fowler's
really nice.
them out-- math...
So if you average
...you got someone
who's okay.
(stammers) But more
than the person,
the Nobel is about the work.
You should understand that
more than anyone.
Yes, because of your work
on gravitational waves.
You know my work?
hogging this conversation.
I do. But I'm-I'm really
(clears throat)
Leonard?
Just give them a chance.
Uh, science has a history
of difficult people.
Newton, who was
Look at, uh,
a jerk to Leibniz, and Leibniz,
who was a jerk to everyone.
don't need to tell you
Yeah, you know, and I
that gravitational waves
are disturbances
in the curvature
of space-time.
Or that the-- Hey, you worked
on the movie
Interstellar?
So what do you think?
I think if you were in space
without a shirt on, you'd die.
Oh.
No, I am wearing
a shirt.
It's just skintight,
so you can see my pecs.
When did you get pecs?
Yesterday, when I made
Stuart add them.
about the other story
Howie, what I liked
was that it was real.

I mean, nothing in this

So, it's a children's book.
I mean, cats
don't wear hats.
And if someone gives you
green eggs, it ends
trying to make a deal with God.
with you on the toilet
But the real story was so sweet.
The little astronaut
was afraid,
and that's what made him brave.
but he still went to space,
the other astronauts...
(scoffs) But in space,
and that's a thing
made fun of him,
he doesn't want to relive.
I get that.
just take a really
I guess it would

story like that
just so it might help
out into the world,

not feel so alone.

Wow. That is
Are you sure you're not Jewish?
so proud of her husband,
I'm just a wife that is
that he has anything
and doesn't think
Oh.
to be embarrassed about.
You're sounding
less and less Jewish.
Hey, we just heard that
you're the ones
the Nobel Laureates to come.
who convinced
PENNY:
You are welcome.
Thank you.
You guys deserve this.
Yeah, now get out of here,
go talk to some
smart people.
Yeah, sorry.
Sometimes I forget
Wait a minute.
you're smart because
you're so sexy.
Yeah.
I can see that.
Dr. Cooper.
Dr. Fowler.
I was just telling Professor
Arnold how you came up with
at your wedding.
super-asymmetry
It's a wonderful story.
Ha, it really is.
I wouldn't say it was the
highlight of the wedding,
because I've been
told not to
for reasons I don't
fully understand.
Uh, but what he does understand
is how the universe works,
what's important.
and that's
of his mouth. (laughs)
Not what comes out
Uh-oh.
I haven't been to a lot of
parties like this,
but what does a physics
rumble look like?
Hmm.
angry chickens.
Kind of like
when-when puppets fight.
Or-or-or-or like, uh,
Dr. Cooper, Dr. Fowler,
good to see you.
What are you doing here?
Professor Smoot
invited us.
Smooty!
We're Facebook friends.
Well, this is our
reception, so go away.
SHELDON:
Actually, Amy,
I think we should
let them stay.
Please, enjoy yourselves.
Try some pigs
in blankets.

And yes, that
Thanks.
Great.
What are you doing?
everyone will see
If they stay,
on super-asymmetry
that their grasp
is tenuous at best.
Oh. That's clever.
the plurals of things, Amy.
Yeah, I don't just know
Is this gonna be
a problem?
Mm? No, no, no.
We have a plan.
Uh, Dr. Campbell
and Pemberton,
settle a bet for
Dr. Fowler and me?
We were just discussing,
under what conditions
the radiative corrections
to super-asymmetry
variation of alpha E.M.?
could cause time
AMY:
I say active galactic nuclei
at cosmological distances
show a part per
million deviation.
Dr. Cooper says
this has been disproven recently
with quasar observations.
What do
you
think?
I agree with
you.
Good answer.
Hey, uh, if we haven't
said it before,
we just want to say...
thank you.
Yeah. We couldn't have proven
super-asymmetry without you.
Wait-wait. You all
heard them say it.
They didn't do anything.
Sheldon. Shut up.
Yeah-- Well, that's rude.
No. Shut up.

Oh, the code
You know, it's strange.
A few months ago,
nobody paid any attention to us,
and now all of a sudden,
we're getting all
these accolades.

Yeah, have-have any
maybe you didn't
deserve it?

Leonard, there's

Okay.
It's crazy. We conclusively
proved super-asymmetry,

There should be

Oh, for crying out loud,

Because you can't have it

are

and you
are!
We're the ones
who discovered super-asymmetry!
So if anyone's gonna feel like
they have imposter syndrome,
it's us, because we're not
imposters!
They
are!
You're imposters
and you're frauds!
Yeah.
Is that what I would've
sounded like?
Yikes!
there was a little astronaut
""Once upon a time,
who was sitting in a rocket
waiting to go to space.""
Three... two... one...
MAN (over radio):
WOLOWITZ:
And while all
the other astronauts
laughed and joked,
he stayed quiet,

He had another secret, too.
He was scared.
scared to trick the alien king.
He was only pretending to be

President Siebert asked that

to help us calmly

and how we can
to point fingers,
We are not here
please stop that.
so, Dr. Cooper,
President Siebert,
would you like to start?
This is all my fault.
(clears throat)
the Nobel Prize was good
I assumed you knew
and we wanted to win it,
so that's on me.
No.
Oh, so...
I think what President Siebert
is trying to say is that
this is a setback and we should
adopt a different strategy.
keep your traps shut.
Like maybe you two
""Traps."" That's a fun old word.
Where's that been?
I-I just-- I-I snapped.
I-I'm sorry.
It's all better then!
Oh, you're sorry!
Listen up, you have a shot
to win a Nobel Prize,
and you're blowing it.
I think what President Siebert
is trying to say
is that you have a shot
to win a Nobel Prize
and you're blowing it.
Uh, that's exactly
what he said.
in my calming H.R. voice.
Yes, but I said it
The science world is
a small community. People talk.
I'm sure by now everyone knows
about your tantrum.
All right, well,
what can we do?
Nothing.
absolutely clear for you.
Let me make this
You two are done talking.
We're canceling your speaking
engagements and your interviews.
and let us do damage control.
You're gonna lie low
Well, if that's what you want,
that's what we'll do.
You two winning the Nobel Prize
is very important to us,
and not just
to the university.
Dr. Fowler, you would be
only the fourth woman
to win a Nobel Prize in physics.
I don't need
to tell you
just how inspirational
that would be
to a generation of young women.
Uh, yes, of-of course, I know.
So, the next words
out of your mouth
Stockholm when you're saying...
should be on a stage in

""Thank you for this honor.""
...which is Swedish for,

...which is Swedish for,
""I knew that.""
Dr. Cooper...
You want me to shut my trap?
I do.
Hey, check it out.
That looks like the moped
you used to have.
It wasn't a moped.
It was a scooter.
(scoffs)
How's that better?
You do not want to walk
into a scooter bar
and ask that question.
take me back.
Well, does

Yeah, the two of us, cruising
Looking
and looking and looking.

Remember that time
Oh, yeah.
We drove away
so fast.
why did you sell the scooter?
Hey, I forget,
I finally got my woman.
(chuckles)
Then my woman made me sell it.
So apparently,
if we win,
I'll be the fourth woman ever
to win a Nobel in physics.
Wow, that's a big deal.
Yeah, tell me about it.
This morning,
I blew through my antiperspirant
in, like, an hour.
Plus, Sheldon's freaking out
'cause we got in trouble.
distracted for a while.
Well, I've got him
how to solve those?
Doesn't he know
Normally, yes, but I switched
the stickers around, so...
it's possible to solve...
I don't even think
Solved it.
What? No, you didn't.
Not the cube, but the puzzle of
why I couldn't solve the cube.
Solution:
you switched stickers
two, nine, 32, and 51.
Really? This thing has numbers?
if you assign it a number,
Anything has a number
friend number four.
Top five, not bad.
This is so frustrating.
the university expects us
I can't believe
to just sit back and do nothing.
Sweetie, you just need to relax.
You know what I like to do?
Numb your brain with alcohol
and watch a reality show
fake arguments with each other?
where wealthy people pick
Hey, don't knock it
until you've wasted
a couple hundred hours
of your life.
I'm sorry, but this is,
it's hard for me.
Usually I self-soothe
by doing science,
but now science reminds me
of the Nobel Prize
and the idea that we may not win
one, and that makes me angry,
self-soothe by doing science,
which makes me want to
and on and on and on.
So that's been my today.

Uh, yeah, a little
You're saying you're happy, but
you're using your mean voice.
Thanks for pointing that out.
Now you got it.
Sheldon, I'm freaking out.
about the Nobel Prize?
Well, is this still
Yes, it's about the Nobel Prize!
And back to the mean voice.
It's just--
it's too much pressure.
You know? It was bad enough
when I was letting us down.
like I'm letting all women down.
But now, if I don't win, it's
What-what are you doing?
Hang on.
when someone's freaking out.
I'm googling what to do
Huh.
Uh, whoa, it says here
that a walk can be calming.
Bye.
Hey.
You still mad?
Are you still a jackass?
Now, now, I asked you first.
I can't believe you were
sneaking around my back
like a child.
(scoffs) I just didn't
want you to worry.
No, you just didn't
want to get caught.
I'm sorry, but you telling me
what I can and can't do
is pretty damn emasculating.
Emasculating?
You were about to ride bitch
on a moped with another man.
It's a scooter.
It can go on some highways.
What if you fell?
What if you got hurt?
I don't want to raise
two small children
and one large vegetable.
I'm sorry, but I need to have
something in my life
that reminds me I'm still a man.
You do.
You have a wife and two children
who need their father.
I know that.
Uh, well, you don't act like it.
that stupid thing anyway?
Why do you want to ride
I don't know.
Maybe I just miss the freedom
I had as a younger man.
You lived with your mother.
What freedom?
You had a curfew.
it was just a time of night
It wasn't a curfew;
where if I got home after that,
she would be mad.
I'm done talking about this.
You know what?
I will!
Do whatever you want.
I just want you to ask yourself
if that tiny, ridiculous scooter
is the hill you want to die on.
(engine revving)
Oh, yeah, this feels good.
Born to ride, buddy.
Yeah, watch out, ladies.
All right, well, wish me luck.
You won't need luck.
Yeah, only condoms.
He sees that car, right?
I tried to console her,
but nothing seemed to work.
Okay, when you say
you consoled her,
what exactly
does that mean?
I took a walk, I came back,
(sighs)
she was still upset,
so I came here.
what else you could've done.
Well, I don't see
You know, I know she's unhappy,
but I don't know how to help.
Maybe you can't.
LEONARD:
Sometimes people are upset,
is be there for them.
and all you can do
And while I'm there,
what do I do?
Nothing.
Oh, so like what you're doing
right now to help me.
You're up.
(grunts)
don't know what to do
Sheldon, maybe you
because Amy's always
taking care of you.
Of course.
I've taken away the one thing
And by calming down,
that gives her comfort:
caring for me.
That's what you heard?
Yes.
No, I need to have
an emotional meltdown
so she's forced
and forget about herself.
to focus on me
even close to what--
No. Th-That's not
might be your best move. Yeah.
Uh, you know, actually, that
Amy. Thank goodness
you're home.
I don't know if you can tell,
but I am literally
losing my mind.
You are?
Isn't it obvious? I just used
""literally"" figuratively.
Like a crazy person.
What is going on with you?
Are you okay?
No, I am not okay, so I suggest
you start focusing on me
to the exclusion of
your own feelings.
Sheldon, whatever you're doing,
I-I don't have time
for it right now.
I know you're upset,
I'm sorry.
how to make it better.
but I don't know
how you can, either.
I don't know
I mean, I don't know
if anybody can.
I just--
I feel like I'm letting
everybody down.
I'm about to hold you. Would you
like to smell my hand first?
I'm fine.
(sighs)
Thank you.

What does she do?
Oh, that's nice.
She's an E.R. nurse.
No.
Oh, no.
It was a real meet-cute.

Ms. Davis?
Dr. Fowler, how can I help you?
You were right about this Nobel
Prize being bigger than I am,
and you were right
that, like it or not,
I am a role model.
to keep me on the sidelines.
But you are wrong
and I can make a difference.
I am smart, I'm capable,
You make a strong case.
Well said.

Damn right,

Well, how about have a seat?

You have anything with

You're right.

s11ep8.xml,"Can we start the movie?
Before Sheldon gets here?
Last time we did that,
he didn't talk to us for a month.
So do it.
Hold on, where is he?
Well, according to his texts,
he was on the second floor...
...then he stopped to tie his shoe.
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
All tied, and....
-Hello.
-Hi.
Sorry we're late.
Amy took forever tying my shoe.
All right, who's excited
to see a documentary?
Oh, I know this one. Nobody, ever.
Hey, this one's going to be great.
This is about the rivalry between
a cool, renegade scientist, Nikola Tesla...
...and his arch-nemesis,
Thomas Edison.
It's the greatest scientific feud of all time.
You can forget about Leibniz and Newton.
Done. So Tesla is the one
that invented the electric car?
[LAUGHING]
No, Penny.
No, the car is just named after him.
Don't be so smug about it.
You went to see the movie
It...
...because you thought
it was about scary IT guys.
Tesla was a genius
who invented our electrical grid.
-Edison just wanted to get rich and famous.
-Didn't he invent the light bulb?
That's what he wants you to think.
Without the work...
...of Ebenezer Kinnersley, Warren de la Rue
and James Bowman Lindsay...
...you wouldn't know Edison any more
than you know Ebenezer Kinnersley...
...Warren de la Rue
or James Bowman Lindsay.
Isn't he sexy all fired up?
He really gets my current alternating
if you know what I mean.
Edison was kind of a publicity hog
and a bully.
He electrocuted an elephant named Topsy
just to make himself famous.
If I had an elephant named Topsy,
he would want for nothing.
Also, he'd be named Jumbo.
Worse than that,
Edison filmed the first on-screen kiss...
...so he's basically a pornographer.
Although, every time I put that in Wikipedia,
someone takes it out.
-Is your current still alternating?
-We're lucky there aren't elephants in here.
That documentary last night
was better than I thought it would be.
Really? It should've been
about Samuel Morse...
...the way they telegraphed that ending.
I already pretended to laugh at that joke once.
Do I have to do it again?
Yeah, I'd appreciate it.
Samuel Morse, you kill me. Heh-heh.
Leonard, can you drive me to work?
The guys and I were talking
about going to see the Tesla coil...
...at the observatory
if you wanna join.
-Oh, I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.
-Why? What are you doing?
What are you doing? He said he can't go.
Make a sad face and move on.
It's fine.
I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to.
-What does that mean?
-Leonard, sad face, sad face.
I mean, I would like to, but I just can't
because it's classified and top secret.
Hold on, are you still working
for the military?
So glad you figured that out.
It was killing me keeping it a secret.
-I thought they fired you guys.
-They did. But then they hired me back.
Better not be working on our project
because we're a team.
Leonard, there is no I in team.
However there is an I in ""I'm working
with the military and you're not.""
There's five of them in fact.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Hey, hey, I got a big surprise for you.
Is it pie and ice cream?
Wow, did I oversell it. It's Raj and Ruchi.
-Hello.
-Hello. Hi.
-What are you two doing here?
-We won't stay long.
I wanted to drop something off
from me and the girls.
None of the girls at work like me enough
to get me a gift.
Okay, so you know why everyone at the office
has the same handwriting.
I appreciate the thought,
but it's not necessary. I'll be back soon.
Don't worry about work.
You take all the time you need.
Yeah. Just turn off your brain
and let your uterus do its magic.
It's the star of the show now.
I wasn't sure how long I should
let you guys stay. Now I know. Get out.
-Good to see you. You look amazing.
-Thanks for coming.
That bitch.
Oh, come on, he means well.
He's just trying to impress his girlfriend.
I'm talking about Ruchi. She's after my job.
Why do you think she said,
""Take all the time you need""?
Because she was being nice?
No, she's trying to steal my projects
while I'm at home...
...taking care of this useless plant
and my dumb family.
I'm only saying this because I love you
and you can't reach me from that bed...
...but you sound a little crazy.
I love you too, but I could fling this card
in your eye like a ninja throwing star.
I don't believe you.
Why would the military want Sheldon?
I don't know, target practice?
Well, he better not be working
on our guidance system. That was my idea.
Call Colonel Williams
and find out what's going on.
Great. I want answers
and he'd better give them to us.
[LINE RINGING]
-Hello, gentlemen.
-Hi, sir.
Leonard has a question.
Hey, is Sheldon working
on our project again?
-Did he say that?
-No, he wouldn't tell us.
Oh. So he can keep his mouth shut.
How do I get him to do that?
Is he working on our guidance system
or not?
Dr. Cooper contacted us with an idea
on how to modify your technology...
...into a communication system,
and it seemed interesting.
-But our team developed that technology.
-And he was your team leader.
-Who said he was team leader?
-He did.
-I like that kind of take-charge attitude.
-We can have take-charge attitudes.
Why didn't either of you ask
to be team leader?
We didn't wanna step on anyone's toes.
Yes, so we were just waiting
for you to tell us who you thought--
Okay, I hear it.
-Are we done?
LEONARD: No. No.
I am taking charge right now
and telling you that it is not okay with us--
Oh, yeah. Okay, bye.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
-Hey, I just got your text. Everything okay?
-Yeah, there's just something I need to ask you.
Oh, Bernie, I'd be thrilled.
It's not ""be my birth coach.""
Okay, that hurts,
but luckily I know how to breathe through it.
[BREATHING RAPIDLY THEN EXHALING]
I need you to find out if Ruchi is trying
to steal my projects while I'm on bed rest.
She's not that kind of a person.
-She's generous and charitable.
-You're just saying that...
-...because she's sleeping with you.
-Yes, that's my favorite charity.
I know I sound paranoid,
but I'm feeling really vulnerable.
If there's anything you can find out,
it'd be great.
And if she is up to anything,
what are you gonna do?
Nothing. I'll calmly talk to her...
...and explain there's boundaries
that need to be respected.
It's really for the benefit
of everyone at the company.
Okay, what you're saying sounds nice,
but the way you're saying it...
...is causing my testicles
to take cover in my abdomen.
-What do you want to watch?
-Why don't you pick?
Okay, how about a comedy?
Eh. I already laughed today.
I know. It was when I stubbed my toe.
Heh. Still funny.
-Drama?
-Nah, I've already seen someone cry today.
It really hurt, Sheldon.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
-Hey, we talked to Colonel Williams.
-He told us everything.
Can we do this another time?
Amy's just about to realize
she wants to watch a
Hulk
marathon.
-What's going on?
-Sheldon went to the Air Force...
-...behind our backs.
-I did nothing of the sort.
I had an idea for a neutrino-based
communication system...
...I presented it, they were interested.
But your communication system
was based on our guidance system.
And sonar is based on bats...
...you don't see them hanging upside down
in a patent attorney's office.
You know what,
you like to think you're just like Tesla...
-...but the truth is, you're like Edison.
-You take that back.
No, he's right. You are a bully,
a credit hog and a self-promoter.
And if anyone around here
is like Tesla, it's us.
Yeah.
Can you believe
they said I was just like Edison?
And in front of a lady no less.
You are building on their work
and taking the credit for it.
That's a classic Edison move.
Oh, yeah? Well, if I'm Edison
and you love me...
-...then what does that say about you?
-I honestly don't know.
Okay, well, I have to Google some stuff
about Mrs. Edison. I'll be right back.
-You know whose fault this is?
-I do. Yours.
No, my mother's.
""Go make friends, Sheldon.""
And what happens?
Twenty years later, they call me names.
I don't think what they called you
is the point here.
Oh, yeah? How would you feel...
...if I called you the name
of a neuroscientist you didn't like?
Do you know the name
of any neuroscientist?
-Of course.
-Not me.
Then, no.
Do you think they're right, Amy?
Do you think I'm like Edison?
Well, Sheldon, I don't think you're upset...
...because of what kind of scientist
they said you're like.
I think you're upset
because your friends' feelings got hurt.
You're right.
I care too much
about other people's feelings.
It's always been my fatal flaw.
-Sheldon, I don't think--
-Not now, Amy. I'm growing as a person.
That was fun.
Put it there, buddy.
I'm not fist bumping you
after we have sex.
You're the one who wanted
to keep things casual.
There's a difference
between casual and weird.
Not the way I do it.
So...
...how was your day like? How's work?
Oh, great. With Bernadette gone,
I'm getting to handle all her projects.
Well, she's not gone. She'd be back soon.
Not too soon let's hope.
So it turns out Ruchi is totally trying
to take over Bernadette's projects.
She just told you that out of the blue?
Yeah, yeah, we had just made love.
It was so beautiful.
Our caramel-colored bodies
were entwined like erotic taffy--
Get to the point!
Sorry. Yeah, I asked her about work...
...and she admitted she has her eyes
on Bernadette's projects.
Can't believe she'd take advantage
of a pregnant lady. What did you do?
What do you think I did? I made small talk
for 20 minutes and had sex again.
You have to say something to Bernie.
If I do that, she's gonna confront Ruchi
and Ruchi's gonna stop sleeping with me--
Raj, you can't go on sleeping with a woman
who's trying to screw over your friend.
Can't or must?
That guidance system was my idea.
You figured out how to make it work.
We didn't need Sheldon.
Let's not forget your idea
was based on my theory.
Hey, we're bagging on Sheldon here! Focus!
He was smart using our quantum technology
as the basis for a communication system.
Be even better
if he swapped out the helium for xenon.
Ooh. So instead of having to keep it
at negative 271 degrees...
...you keep it at negative 108.
It would be way more efficient.
Xenon has a bigger nucleus, so coherence
would make it an easier signal to see.
-You're brilliant.
-We should tell Sheldon.
You're an idiot. We don't tell Sheldon.
We go to the military behind his back
and we screw him like he screwed us.
Right, we don't need him.
We can do this all on our own.
-Do you think you can do the math?
-No.
But if someone else does it,
I can double-check the crap out of it.
I want you to know, I did what you asked.
I talked to Ruchi
and found out what's going on at work.
-Is she's trying to steal my projects?
-Not trying to. It's a done deal.
Here, have a brownie.
-I'll kill her.
-Don't take this out on Ruchi.
Is she trying to take your job? Yes.
Is she parking in your space? Yes.
Did she get a laugh at a meeting yesterday
by calling you ""Pregnadette""? Big one.
But you would've done
the exact same thing and you know it.
-I never would've undermined a co-worker.
-Please.
What about that guy Eric who you told
it was Bring Your Cat to Work Day...
...when you knew your boss had asthma?
That was just a hilarious prank
that ended with me getting a corner office.
All I'm saying is, before you attack Ruchi,
maybe you should take a look in the mirror...
...because you know what you'll see
apart from radiant skin...
...and luxuriously thick hair? Hypocrisy.
It is thick.
So, what do you think?
Can you make it work?
I just need to use the cross section
to calculate the probability of the interaction.
Can we help?
Yes, why don't you run
and get me a can of Pringles?
Leonard, I was-- What's Kripke doing here?
Helping us develop a better,
more efficient neutrino comm system...
...that we'll pitch to the military.
-Leonard thought of it. Genius.
-Thanks. Instead of liquid helium--
-Good God, man, shut up!
-Sorry.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You didn't tell me
we were doing this just to stick it to Sheldon.
Oh, well....
I'm messing with you.
This sundae just got a cherry on top.
Fine, good luck to you. The military
is already interested in my system...
...and my math is worked out.
His still has a big gap in it.
Where?
There.
Can I ask you a question?
Does a drug still count
as an anti-depressant...
...if its number one side effect
is uncontrollable weeping?
I don't know,
I always feel better after a good cry.
I've been trying to ask Bernadette
but she's not answering any of my texts.
Yeah, listen, I think she might
be a little threatened by you...
...because you can tie your own shoes
and laugh without peeing.
-Did she say something to you?
-No.
I mean, well, kind of.
But it's okay, she's just hormonal.
And don't worry, I stood up for you.
I don't need you to stand up for me.
You're not my boyfriend.
Look, I care about you and you can say
that this doesn't mean anything...
...but the truth is, we're in a relationship.
Figure out some way to deal with it.
I can't believe she dumped me.
This is tough for me, because I can.
Sorry things worked out like that.
Because I'm in pain
or because you don't have a spy anymore?
Let's just leave it at ""I'm sorry.""
You're already sad.
Based on Kripke's calculations,
I think this is gonna work.
We should pitch it to Williams today.
Why limit ourselves to the U.S. military?
There's other places we could take this.
-Without committing criminal espionage?
-It's easy to shoot an idea down, Leonard.
Well, I suppose congratulations
are in order.
You set out to destroy me
and you achieved your goal.
-What you are talking about?
-The military canceled my project.
-They're going with yours.
-That's impossible.
We haven't even pitched it yet.
Colonel Williams said another team at Caltech
came up with a neutrino comm system.
Damn it.
Excuse us.
Kripke.
-What's up, fellas?
-Did you screw us over?
Ooh. I can't tell you that. It's classified.
Why did you tell Barry Kripke your idea?
This is all your fault.
It's your fault. If you would have come to us,
none of this would've happened.
If it helps, you all behaved terribly
and you deserve what you got.
Well, that doesn't help at all.
You know,
sometimes your social skills are very poor.
I can't believe we let Kripke use us like that.
Maybe you're all more like the guy
who didn't invent the electric car...
...and less like the guy
who didn't invent the light bulb.
She's right. Maybe we're all a bunch
of Teslas after all.
Didn't Tesla die penniless,
forgotten and insane?
You may have a point
about her social skills.
-He wasn't insane.
-He did fall in love with a pigeon.
Well, if we're gonna call Tesla crazy
for loving something small and unappealing...
...might as well put Penny in a padded cell."

And at, like, $5000 apiece, that's--
Like a lot of money,
which we agreed to share.

I can't believe we forgot.
Not that surprising.

Stuart, I was wondering.
Will you be accepting Bitcoin?
I don't know what that is,
but it's got ""coin"" in it...
...and my cash register doesn't.
So yeah.
What's Bitcoin?
It's a new online currency
that's been developed.
It's like actual money,
except you can't see it...
...hold it, or spend it on anything.
Sounds like the kind of money
I'm familiar with.
If it's not tangible, how do you know
it's not gonna vanish tomorrow?
You're dating Penny. You're gonna poke...
...at something that could vanish tomorrow?
I'll buy Bitcoin. I came into a little extra money
when my dad raised my allowance.
You don't have to buy Bitcoin.
You can mine it.
-Mine it? Like mining gold?
-Sort of. There's a limited amount.
We find it, not by tunneling
into the earth...
...but by using a computer to solve
complex mathematical problems.
Let me get this straight,
we have to write a program...
...in order to find a fake coin
that we can't spend on anything?
-Yes.
-That sounds fun. Heh.
-I'm in.
-Staying up late, writing code?
Sounds like a party.
Stuart, wanna mine
some Bitcoin with us?
-We write the program, you bring the snacks?
-Too rich for my blood.
All right, it's just the four of us.
Before we begin, this may have
unprecedented tax implications.
We should start early. We're gonna be
on the phone with the IRS for hours.
Did anyone else just get goosebumps?
Great, so just the three of us.
-Oh, yeah, we did it without you.
-Do you remember what happened next?
Your mom called my mom
and said we were being mean?
And after that....
You said that someday we'd regret this.
And do you know what today is?
The day we found out we're rich
and none of it is yours?

Yeah, that's right. Up top.
This is the laptop I was using in 2010.
The Bitcoin must be on here.
What are you gonna do
with your share of the money?
As a responsible adult,
I'll put that money into a CD.
Wait for that CD to mature,
and then buy a tiger.
How about you?
It depends on whether I tell
Bernadette or not. Heh.

Maybe it's in that folder:

It's not!
The program's almost ready to run.
Mining for coins sounds so manly.
Ooh, we should sing a mining song.
Do you know a mining song?
I don't know.
Does ""TiK ToK"" by Kesha count?
Because it has tunneled its way
into my heart.

No, we're not rough-housing.
We're scientists.
Scientists don't rough-house.

Some oldies.
We can use my laptop.
Howard, I made cookies
for you and your little friends.
They're not my little friends.
We don't want cookies.
-A cookie sounds good.
-We'll have cookies, thank you very much.
-It must be on my old laptop.
-Let's go.
-Bernie, mind if I run to Leonard's and--
-Get a laptop full of money?
Why are you still here? Go, go, go.
So how's the wedding planning going?
Great, although we're having trouble
agreeing on a location.
Thought you were looking at a cliff
on the beach.
We were, but Sheldon didn't like
any of them.
Some were too beachy,
some were too cliff-y....
And all of them were too outside-y.
Well, weddings aren't about location. They're
about standing in front of family and friends.
Promising Sheldon will never
move back in here.
-Hi.
PENNY: Hey.
-What are you guys doing?
-We have a bunch of Bitcoin...
...on an old laptop.
Could be worth a lot of money.
-You're kidding.
-We could be sitting on a fortune.
Let the record show I didn't marry you
for money, but you got way more attractive.
Damn it, it's not in here.
If only you had someone around
with an eidetic memory.
I bet they would know
what happened to it.
If you know, just tell us.
If I recall from 7 years ago,
you don't want me to be a part of this.
Sheldon, you can't still be mad.
Please. I have grudges
that go back to preschool.
Someday I'm gonna find
a grown-up Elaine Dwyer...
...and eat her favorite crayon
while she watches.
Is that why there's an Elaine Dwyer
on our guest list?
Yes. That night I'm going to have
the first dance and the last laugh.
Sheldon, please.
-Should I be the bigger man?
-I think you should.
Oh. Why did I ask you?
-Hey, pretty lady.
-I'm not waiting on your table for you.
-Come on, this one is so annoying.
-Excuse me, waitress.
-You guys ready to order?
-Can you take our picture?
Oh. Sure. Smile.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS]
-Perfect. Heh.
-Thank you. You may go now.
It was nice to meet you.
And I mean that politely, not sincerely.
-What was that?
-I need to prove to my mother that I'm on a date.
If she thinks I faked the picture, I might need
you as a witness. What's your name?
Bernadette.
Hey. Everybody good?
-Yeah, fine.
-Sure.
[WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY]
You don't have to whisper.
You can nod your head.
Or you can speak.
-Having a good day?
-No, I missed an audition.
My computer broke.
I didn't get the e-mail.
-Would've been a perfect part.
-Was it ""waitress who ignores customers""?
Because that's a role you were born to play.
Shut up and eat your burger.
-It's a turkey club.
-Didn't you order a burger?
I did, and yet, here we are.
If you need a computer,
you can use my laptop.
-I'm not gonna take your computer.
-I'm getting a new one.
-Are you sure?
SHELDON: Don't be silly.
He's desperate to hold on to you.
You can get anything out of him.
-His car, his watch--
-Maybe a kidney.
You already have his testicles.
You can start a collection. Heh.
-You gave me your laptop. That was so sweet.
-You know where it is?
-Of course.
-Great.
-Yes.
-I gave it to my ex-boyfriend, Zack.
-No.
-Why?
Zack, thank you. We'll be right over.
He still has it.
I can't believe you took a gift from me
and gave it to another man.
SHELDON:
Really?
Of all the things she's given to other men,
that's what you're concerned about?
Don't make a big deal about this.
It was a long time ago. We were broken up.
Which breakup was that?
Was that the St. Valentine's Day massacre?
No, no, no, this might be during
the Comic-Con dumpathon.
-You have names for our breakups?
-They would blur together if we didn't.
The Comic-Con breakup's easy to remember
because Leonard was the saddest Pikachu.
And he wiped his nose on your cape.
Then you were the saddest Darth Vader.
Penny and I aren't the only ones who've
broken up. So did Howard and Bernadette.
Len, not to brag, but all my breakups
have lasted.
-Sorry to hear about you and Howard.
-Thanks.
I didn't think he was the kind of guy
who would be doing weird stuff online.
Really? Wow, I thought it was
so obvious, but okay.
I know it's hard...
...the best thing to do after a breakup
is to take some time and be by yourself.
-Yeah, that's healthy.
-Hey, babe, ready to go?
Do as I say, not as I do.
-I cannot believe you're mad.
-I'm not mad.
Really? Tell that to your eyebrows.
Bet I can place a quarter
between them and it'd just stay there.
Fine. I'm mad. I guess I was more upset
by our breakup than you.
That's not true. Of course I was upset.
Didn't seem like it.
You started dating the first tall...
...handsome hunk you could find.
I'm sorry, are you mad that I dated Zack,
or that you didn't?
-Hi.
-Hey, Zack.
So good to see you guys.
Man, we should do this more often.
Come over to get laptops back from you?
Totally.
So do you have it?
Of course. Penny gave it to me as a gift.
You don't get rid of something like that.
Huh.
-I am sorry I gave away your stupid laptop.
-You should be.
-We were broken up for five minutes.
-You guys fighting?
-Yeah.
-No.
You fighting about whether or not
you're fighting? I've had that fight before.
Turns out we were, and I lost.
Leonard thinks when we broke up,
it didn't bother me.
Crazy. When we were going out,
she talked about you all the time.
In fact, I think she only dated me
because I reminded her of you.
Sure.
Because we're both...
...people?
Damn right we are.
Also, there's that video about
how much she missed you.
-What video?
-The one on the laptop.
Didn't mean to invade your privacy,
but I am a huge snoop. Heh.
Ask my neighbor. She'll tell you.
But not now, she's in the shower.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Hello, Leonard.
I was gonna write you an e-mail,
but I'm a little drunk...
...and spelling is a sober
person's game, so....
I feel like I owe you ""esplanation.""
I-- Heh. I'm sorry.
""Esplanation.""
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
SHELDON:
Penny? Penny?
-Penny?
-Sheldon, go away. I'm making a video.
I'm sorry, I'll come back when you're alone.
No, no, no, I am alone, I'm just
telling Leonard why I broke up with him.
Oh, he knows.
The video I wanna see is why
you went out with him in the first place.
I went out with him because he's great.
If I kept going out with him,
I would have married him.
It's a little scary because
I don't think I'm ready for that.
Plus I have got to learn
how to spell Hofstadter.
I know there's a ""D"" in there,
but it keeps moving every time I try and write it.
Sheldon, what do I do?
Try to pass out face down
so you don't choke on your vomit.
I am not gonna pass out.
Th-- Bu-- Thank you, anyway.
Wow.
I know. There's like two more hours
of her just lying there.
-Aww. You love me so much.
-I married you, jackass.
And not just out of pity, like everyone said
at our wedding toast.
-Wanna see where she falls off the chair?
-Totally.
No.
-That's my wife.
-Huh.
I gotta see that again.
-Got the laptop.
-Hand it here.
Yup.
-This is so exciting.
-When we sell the Bitcoin...
...you gonna pay your dad back
all the money you took over the years?
Never even crossed my mind.
-Okay, here's the Bitcoin folder.
-How much is in there?
-It's empty.
-What? That's impossible.
[STAMMERS]
-You think Zack stole it?
-He doesn't know how to steal Bitcoin.
He waves at trucks.
Hmm. Who could it have been?
-Sheldon, what did you do?
-I plotted my revenge.
If you get a dish,
I'll serve you some, cold.
You stole our Bitcoin?
Calm down. All I did was sneak onto your
computer and download your Bitcoin...
-...onto a flash drive.
-What?
But I'm not keeping it,
I just wanted to watch you sweat.
If you wanna watch him sweat,
walk up a flight of stairs with him.
I've waited seven long years,
but it finally happened.
Where's our money?
That's the best part.
It's on the Batman flash drive on your keychain.
You've had it in your pocket all along.
Sheldon.
I lost that keychain years ago.
Really?
Did you look under things?
Well, that is unfortunate.
I guess we've all learned a lesson today.
-What was the lesson?
-I don't know.
STUART:
Huh. What's that?
Ooh. Batman flash drive.
That's pretty cool.
Huh. If I erase this, I could probably resell it
for like 10 bucks.
Things are finally going my way."

like Luke Cage.
I'm too tired
to even be disturbed by that.
Sheldon?
Mm, absolutely not, no.
The Nobel committee will be
making the calls to inform
the winners at any minute,
so the only drug I need
is the endorphins pumping
through my brain
in anticipation of our victory.
Well, technically, anticipation
wouldn't be mediated
by endorphins as much
as dopamine, but, you know,
you've been up all night,
so I'll give you that one.
Really? The second
he stops talking?
Well... should we wake him up?
Well, he did say
if he fell asleep,
we were allowed
to slap him awake.
Oh, boy.
Wait a minute.
Why do you get to do it?
'Cause I called it.
Well, you can't just call it.
You have to earn it.
Oh, and you've earned it?
No one has earned it
more than me.
(Amy clearing throat)
You have your whole life
to smack him around.
This is my time.
Fine. Don't miss.
It's not a volleyball.
I can handle it.
Oh, wait. Hang on.
When you're old, you are
gonna want a record of this.
Oh, oh, yeah.
Do it in slo-mo.
I want to see his cheeks ripple.
Ready... go.
(ringtone playing)
(gasps)
It's happening!
Unknown caller.
It's got to be them.
Okay, put it on speaker.
Hello?
Hi.
MAN:
Hello. This is Sweden calling.
Is this Dr. Cooper
and Dr. Fowler?
Yes.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
It is my pleasure to inform you
that you've won the Nobel Prize
in being suckers...!
His Swedish accent
was very convincing.
(ringtone playing)
(gasps)
This is it!
What do you want, Howard?
We were just calling to see
if you'd heard yet.
We haven't.
But thank you for getting up
so early to call.
That was very thoughtful.
Oh, please. We have
two little kids.
We've been up for an hour.
WOLOWITZ:
Did anyone get to slap Sheldon?
No.
Okay, well, call us
when you hear.
All right,
now what?
Oh, why don't we play a game
to pass the time?
Here. Uh, I am thinking
of a number.
Hint: it's a cube of a cube
of a prime.
There's an infinite number
of possibilities.
What, you got somewhere to be?
(ringtone playing)
Oh. That's me.
Hello?
Yes, this is Dr. Fowler.
I see.
Okay, thank you.
We won.
(gasps)
Congratulations!
Oh, my God!
We did it.
I know.
Can you believe it?
(gasps)
That's a good point.
What if I'm dreaming?
(yelps)
We won the Nobel Prize!

And how does it feel to be

You tell me.
Oh. Amy-centric--
what a fun way to look at it.
I think so.
You would.
That makes sense.
(phone vibrates)
Ooh.
Aw. It's a congratulations text
from my meemaw.
(phone vibrates)
Ooh. Oh, and there's
one from my mom.
(phone vibrates)
And my sister.
(phone vibrates)
Oh, and my brother.
(phone vibrates)
And my brother's ex-wife.
(phone vibrates)
My brother's other ex-wife.
Boy, they don't tell you
when you win a Nobel
it chews up
your phone battery.
(phone vibrates)
AMY:
Oh, that's me.
It's CVS.
My prescription's ready.
(phone vibrates)
Oh, and also my dad.
He says congratulations
and he loves me.
Nothing about me?
(phone vibrates)
Oh.
Oh, it's your dad. I'm good.
You know, when you
think about it,
now that we're Nobel
Prize winners,
our names will be linked
together forever.
We're married.
Our names are already
linked together forever.
Oh, please. That's
just a piece of paper.
This is a piece of paper
and a medal.
AMY:
It's weird.
I don't really
feel different,
but I guess our lives
will never be the same.
Oh, I don't know. We're
going to work like always.
I still put my pants on
both legs at a time.
One day that's
gonna end very badly.
(reporters shouting)
Congratulations.
How does it feel?
Okay, w-we're happy
to answer your questions,
Just, um,
one at a time, please?
REPORTER:
Dr. Cooper!
Is Dr. Cooper coming back?
No. Next question.
(reporters shouting)
Was it your left hand
or your right hand?
Right.
Spit actually flew
out of his mouth.
SIEBERT:
Hey, fellas.
Can you do me a favor?
Do we have a choice?
Ha-ha! No.
Sheldon and Amy
are now officially superstars,
and the press
will be reaching out to their
family and friends for comment.
So that we're all
on the same page,
the word we're gonna use
to describe them is ""quirky.""
And not
quirky.
More like
quirky.
So not Mr. and Mrs.
Wackadoodle?
SIEBERT:
Ho-ho-ho!
You bitter, envious little man.
Thank you so much.
And what do we call that?
Quirky.
Quirky.
Quirky.
Dr. Cooper, can I get
a minute of your time?
Hello?
Hey.
Can I help you?
Uh, yeah, actually.
Um, I had an appointment
to interview Dr. Cooper
about the Nobel.
Hang on a second.
Sheldon?
Sorry, he's not here.
Damn. I've got a deadline.
I don't know
if it helps you at all,
but I'm his best friend
in the whole world.
Really?
And an astronaut. Come on,
you can buy me a cup of coffee,
and I'll tell
you about both.
(Amy sobbing)
Everyone okay in there?
Go away!
Amy?
Raj, please, not now.
Hey, what's wrong?
My picture's
all over the Internet,
and I look terrible.
No. Let me see.
Well, that is
an unfortunate angle.
But who cares?
You just won the Nobel.
You should be proud
of this moment.
I know I shouldn't care
about how I look,
and I never thought I did.
It-It's stupid and shallow,
but I just can't help it.
Am I really this frumpy?
No. No, you are
a beautiful woman.
By the way,
if you're not happy
with those pictures,
then make some changes.
Get a haircut, new clothes,
new glasses, big glasses...
No glasses-- then you won't
be able to see those pictures.
Sounds expensive.
Excuse me,
i-if I'm not mistaken,
the Nobel comes with
a substantial cash prize.
What were you gonna
spend it on?
Hadn't really
thought about it.
Sheldon's got his eyes
on some new Dockers.
Come on.
Do something for yourself.
Well, I suppose
I could get a haircut.
And some makeup
and a new wardrobe
and a little thank you gift
for your shopping buddy
if we see something
he likes. Come on.
Where are we going?
Beverly Hills,
where the things he likes are.
Dinner ready?
Not unless you cooked.
Why is this article
about Sheldon all about you?
Let me see.
Oh, good, they used
my NASA picture.
Why does it say that
you're his best friend?
Leonard's his best friend.
No. Leonard
has always been
kind of a monkey butler.
Whenever Sheldon
got into a scrape,
I was his go-to guy.
(chuckles)
When did he get
into a scrape?
You're kidding, right?
W-- Remember
when he had a panic attack
'cause his hand got stuck
in a jar of olives?
I was the one who told him
to let go of the olives.
Please, that doesn't
make you his best friend.
(chuckles)
You know,
that reporter asked me
if I could put him in touch
with...
Amy's best friend.
That's Penny.
(singsongy):
Doesn't have to be.
Hmm.
What kind of tea
is appropriate
for winning a Nobel Prize
and now everything is changing
and you feel unmoored
from reality?
I don't know. Earl Grey?
You know,
this is something
I've wanted my whole life.
But I guess I never considered
how everything
would be different.
Buddy, I-I know it all feels
overwhelming right now,
but I promise you,
things will settle down.
There's no Earl Grey!
You filthy liar!
(knocking at door)
Hey, is Penny here?
No. Why?
I wanted to show her
my latest creation.
I give you...
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
Wow. Amy, you
look amazing.
Thank you.
Sheldon, what do you think?
I like you better
the way you were.
But she looks
beautiful!
Classic lines,
colors that complement
her skin tone,
and hair that goes from ""office""
to ""on the town"" in minutes.
I don't care.
Put it back.
I like the way I look.
Well, I don't!
(door opens)
My fault.
I was out of Earl Grey.
(clears throat)
Sheldon, that was really rude.
I'm sorry. Amy is
the one constant I can count on,
and now she's changing.
It's just a haircut
and some clothes.
No, it's
the last straw!
I can't take any more!
(elevator bell dings)
Can you believe it?
They finally fixed the elevator.
This is
a nightmare.
What's with him?
He won a Nobel Prize,
and his wife looks amazing.
Oh. Yeah, got it.
(panting)
(gasping, panting)
How did you get down here?
The elevator. It's really fast.
I-I need to be alone right now.
Don't try to follow me.
All right.
You need a ride?
That'd be great.
Thank you.
I should've seen this coming.
Oh, stop. You're allowed
to get a haircut.
I know.
But I should've done it
gradually.
You know, like...
maybe 300 tiny haircuts
over a ten-year period.
Okay, you need to
focus on the positive.
You won a Nobel Prize.
I slapped Sheldon.
A lot of dreams
came true today.
You know, you're right.
This is a huge day for me,
and I'm allowed to enjoy it
without worrying how
it's going to affect my husband.
Is it me
or did it just
get fierce in here?
All this change
is just too much.
The reporters,
the attention at work,
and now even Amy's changed.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.
I'm playing a
drinking game.
Every time you say
the word ""change,""
I take a slug.
Are you gonna be able
to drive me home?
Mm. Not unless you
change the subject.
Huh. Now I said it.
Meh. Hmm.
You know, you're the
only person who could win
the biggest prize in science
and still be upset about it.
It's just...
all the times
I thought about winning,
I never thought
about how it would ch--
affect my life.
I'm sorry, I'm genuinely
concerned about your liver.
(chuckles):
Okay.
Fine, I'll stop playing.
You know, you go on and on about
wanting things to stay the same,
but you've changed a
lot since I met you.
Oh, you are a mean drunk.
I'm serious.
You have a ton of friends,
you got married, moved
into a new apartment,
you wore a baseball
hat that one time.
Heck, you've had sex almost as
many times as I have fingers.
More.
W...
By this many.
You dog!
It was the
Avengers
trailer.
Oh. Mm-hmm.
You know, I've grown, too.
I used to be the bartender
back there.
That's true.
And now there is
a completely different woman
who botched my drink order.
How hard is 65% Coke,
35% Diet Coke?
Well, judging
by the look on her face,
it's at least
one percent saliva.
I do take your point.
You know,
you're also married,
you have a successful career,
you no longer dress
like you're trying
to attract sailors by the wharf.
So, I guess the only thing
that actually stays the same
is that things are
always changing.
Interesting.
So you're saying
the inevitability of change
might be
a universal constant.
Well, there's a little more to
it than that, but, yeah, sure.
Oh. Hey, look,
that's Bernadette.
I can't tell you how many times
Dr. Fowler was gonna give up
and I would say to her,
""Amy, as your best friend,
I'm not gonna let you quit.""
Okay, I'm drinking again.
I'll join you.
Waitress,
uh, 95% Hawaiian Punch,
five percent vodka.
WOLOWITZ:
Let me tell you about the time
Mr. Nobel Laureate
wanted olives...
(laughs)
This is a good one.
You know what, 90/10!
You know, I like
the way my hair looks.
I'm done tiptoeing
around him.
We're all guilty of it.
But why?
'Cause we were afraid
to upset him.
Which happens anyway.
Well, that's over.
I'm-I'm done enabling him.
Like,
this is his spot
and-and the thermostat
has to be set
to
his
comfort level,
even though he doesn't
even live here anymore
and I'm always chilly.
Is that why you wear
a hoodie all the time?
Why would-- Yes!
To accommodate
Sheldon!
And what-what
about this-this thing?
Why is it here?
I'll tell you why.
Because it was here
when I moved in,
and, for no earthly reason,
he forbade me to touch it.
Well, if you don't like it,
get rid of it.
Put it in the closet.
You know what,
I will.
I bet that's the reason.
Hang on.
What do you think?
Want to give it a try?
(elevator bell dings)
Well, you know,
the elevator did work
when I moved into the building.
So going up and down the stairs
was a change,
which means this would actually
be a return to the status quo.
But, conversely,
I think...
Get in!

we-we still feel like imposters.

It's called
""imposter syndrome,""
because you can't have it

We're the ones who discovered

Why do you say he's a weasel?

was to take other people's ideas
and turn them in as his own.
That's exactly what
he's doing to us.
I'm not surprised. I heard the
only work he did on his thesis
""Where can I buy a thesis?""
was googling,
Well, plagiarism is a pretty
serious charge. Are you sure?
I can make some calls.
You want proof?
You'd do that for us?
I really don't want to see
that guy win a Nobel.

I also don't want

It sounds a little sleazy.

So I was talking
to my mom

about our Pemberton
Really? What'd she say?
Apparently, Old Testament God
would bring down his wrath
on them for being deceitful,
but New Testament God
would forgive them.
So couldn't we just
bring down our wrath
and ask the New Testament God
to forgive us?
And?
You know, I asked her
that very question.
She said I was full
of California sass.
Oh, good, you're all here.
Uh, we're wrestling
and perhaps you could help.
with an ethical question,
Fire away.
Sure, what's up?
Yeah.
If we have damaging
and embarrassing information
about someone, should we keep it
to ourselves or expose them?

to do with online tastes

their real-life tastes?
I know all about your

(laughs): Okay, now
So you really think
they should do this?
(stammers) It wouldn't
just knock Pemberton
out of Nobel contention, it
would blow up his whole career.
To that, I say kaboom!
No, I meant
it's a bad thing.
No, no, I agree
with Bernadette.
If Pemberton cheated,
maybe he shouldn't have a career
in the first place.
There's plenty of people
that didn't plagiarize.
And a few of us who did,
but it's only 'cause

Ugh, why is this
Maybe because
you want to win,
but deep down you know it's not
the honorable way to do it.
Otherwise, you would've
done it already.
That's really wise.
Yes, but it may just be
the Indian accent.
Do you think
by not exposing Pemberton
we're doing

Of course.

Oh, she still works there?
Who was it?
Why does it matter?
You're right, it doesn't matter
'cause I got the best one.
Was it Susan?
Why? Because she's tall?
Good night.
Can't believe it.
Sheldon loves telling on people
when they break the rules.
Yeah, well, maybe he's changed.
He hasn't changed. Last week,
when the vending machine
gave me two bags of chips,
he called my mom.
Well, that didn't
ruin your life.
Well, it ruined my day.
I had to talk to my mom,

so that's fun to think about.

Look, I'm proud
this thing on their own merits,

not by knocking out
the competition.
Yeah, but what if
they don't win?
Uh, Pemberton and Campbell
have done an amazing job
of associating their names
with super-asymmetry.
the momentum right now.
They have all
I don't like the idea
of them losing either,
but this is their decision
to make, not ours.
(sighs)
Maybe it is ours.
What do you mean?
don't want to expose Pemberton,
Well, i-if Sheldon and Amy
that doesn't mean someone else
can't do it for them.
They'd never have to know.
Really? You'd do that?
They deserve the Nobel.
I'm not gonna let two frauds
steal it from them.
And if that means getting
my hands dirty, so be it.
What's so funny?
(laughs)
actually seen your hands dirty.
Just realized I've never
All right, Hofstadter, here's
all the proof you need.
Great, thanks.
Just remember,
once you take this envelope,
there's no turning back.
and decide not to use it?
What if I look at it
I had not considered that.
Got to hand it to you,
for making things boring.
you got a real talent
Thanks.
Hey, look at that,
you did it again.
Hi, Leonard.
What? Nothing.
You okay?
Uh, no, you are.
So guess what.
There was a waitress
at The Cheesecake Factory
back in the day
who kind of had a thing for me.
That does not sound right.
Other than Bernadette?
Oh, well, who was it?
Honest to God.
It doesn't even matter.
I'm happily married.
The point is women-- plural--
find me appealing.
Okay. Okay, well,
well, let's see.
Okay? We-we know
it wasn't Penny,
Wait.
we know it wasn't Susan...
How do we know it wasn't Susan?
Uh, because she had a type.
What type?
Don't make me say it.
I'm not a handsome guy?
Are you saying
See? It's mean, right?
Hold on, as we've established,
a minimum of two women
think I'm attractive.
Uh, yeah, you're right,

how long did it take

I don't have any.

Oh, thank you so much.

So does that mean
you think it's aliens?
that there are many unknowns,
I was just illustrating

preemptively rule out

You said I shouldn't
worry about your feelings.
I meant feelings about things
that I don't care about!
Now, I'm not quite sure
when to jump in here...
Not now.
Okay.
Fine, you want to talk about it?
Let's talk about it.
I-I'm not loving
my job right now.
And this is something
that would make me happy.
Don't you want me to be happy?
Oh, I've been dinged
on this before.
Whatever you really think,
you have to say yes.
Of course I want you
to be happy.
Well played.
Okay, I know this seems scary,
but I put together
a strong proposal.
It's good for me,
it's good for the university.

No.

for an answer.

Hmm, yeah, but
somehow, you manage.
Raj, you should have Howard
join you for one of your shows.
Oh, that might be fun.
But-- it might be, but with
two small children at home
and a full-time job,
I'm sure you're too busy.
No, I could find the time.
Well, you don't have
to decide right now.
It's okay, I...
He can't do it.
Hey, hurry up, guys.
The gift shop's closing,
and Amy said
I can get one big thing
or two little things.

So I'm gonna place the sensory
isolation helmet on you
for about five minutes.
All you need to do
is sit still and relax.
What do I do if I start
to get claustrophobic?
Oh, the helmet will sense that
and stop the experiment.
Really?
No, but that would
be cool, wouldn't it?
Amy, are you busy?
I've got a subject wired up
for a sensory study.
So...
Yes, I'm busy.
Oh.
I'm tracking a subject's
brain activity
in real time as we
introduce olfactory stimuli.
I'm smelling baby powder.
That's just my husband.
Well, I had a thought about
our super-asymmetry theory.
Let me show you this one thing.
Well, I-I want to see it,
but not when I'm in the middle
of an experiment.
Still baby powder!
Boy, he is annoying. Do any
of those buttons shock him?
Look, I'm really excited
about our paper, too,
but I've got
a lot of my own work
to catch up on,
so let's talk later.
Okay, I'll just say one
more thing: lambda calculus.
And if that wets your whistle,
you know where to find me.
Boop.
You okay? You seem distracted.
I'm-I'm just thinking about Raj.
I'm thinking about
Chris Hemsworth. Let's go.
He sort of hurt my feelings.
(quietly): Biceps, hammer, abs.
Still in it.
Why wouldn't he want me to be
in his planetarium show?
And it's gone.
Sorry, it's just the director
of the planetarium thought
it'd be fun for me to join Raj
for one of his shows,
and he made it clear
that he didn't want me to.
Of course he wouldn't
want you to.
I mean, think about it.
If you were him,
would you want to share the
stage with a sexy-ass astronaut?
I don't know.
How sexy are we talking?
Oh, you know, tight pants,
huge biceps, magic hammer.
Wait, w-who are we talk...
Shh, I'm back in it.
SHELDON: (stammers)
The fundamental problem
with elementary quantum
mechanical formalism
is that the Fourier transform
extends to minus infinity
in time.
Hey, don't dumb this down
for me.
Penny, I'm...
Late for that thing. See you.
Leonard!
Oh, Sheldon.
Didn't see you there. What's up?
Well, uh, he was
excited to talk science
with Amy,
but she was working late,
so he decided to come over
and share it with me.
With me, Leonard.
With me.
Sheldon,
we've talked about this.
You can't go around
boring other people's wives.
PENNY:
Yeah.
I already got a man for that.
Yeah, you do.
Yeah.
It's just, I've
just been enjoying
my collaboration with Amy,
but ever since we got back
from our honeymoon,
she has so little time.
Well, she does have her own job.
Yeah, but it's so dull.
Trying to understand
how the brain
translates the five senses
into biochemical information.
I'd rather wait in line
without my phone.
Okay, well, Leonard's here now.
You can talk science with him.
Where you going?
Oh, that thing
you were late for.
One of us should
really be there.
Hey. Got a sec?
Sure. What's up?
I just want to let
you know I get
why you don't want me to be
a part of the planetarium show.
Oh, great.
Thanks for stopping by.
You don't want to talk
about the stars
next to an actual astronaut.
That would be like doing karaoke
with a rock star.
First of all, I've totally done
karaoke with a rock star.
Or are you forgetting
when the Spin Doctors
handed me the mic
at the Orange County Fair?
Listen, I understand
you being intimidated,
but I can't help that I'm proud
of being an astronaut.
It's a big deal.
Oh, it certainly is,
but I also happen to be
very accomplished in my field.
Great. So you have no reason
to be scared
of sharing the spotlight.
Please. I may be scared
of heights and spiders
and showing up
at a costume party
that turns out
to be a regular party,
but I am not scared of sharing
the spotlight with you!
What's happening?
I just stormed out
for dramatic effect.
I... Actually, I-I don't have
anywhere to go.
President Siebert, how much
do you know about physics?
I'm a physicist.
Huh. I would not
have guessed that.
I have a doctorate
from Indiana University.
Oh, that makes more sense.
Well, don't worry, I'll go slow.
Thank you.
Dr. Fowler and I have
been working on
a theory of super-asymmetry
that could reconcile the lack
of observation of supersymmetry
in a world still governed
by string theory.
Interesting. So you're taking
the paradigms of supersymmetry,
but removing the limitations
of obeying the Poincaré algebra.
Well, aren't you just
the pride of Bloomington?
What do you want, Sheldon?
Dr. Fowler has
found herself distracted
by the commitments
in her own lab.
It would be a great help
to both of us
if you could free her up
from her other projects.
I'm confused.
Yeah, well, there's
that Indiana.
This is physics research.
Dr. Fowler's a neuroscientist.
Y-Yes,
but her insights
into the very ways
we conceptualize symmetry and
asymmetry have been invaluable.
Dr. Cooper...
L-Look, I know
what you're thinking,
that ""they're newlyweds,
how are they gonna keep
their hands off of each other?""
Let me assure you, we will not
engage in workplace coitus.
Okay, if I won't
put a bagel on my desk,
I'm certainly not putting
Amy's bare bottom.
I-I must say,
I do not enjoy our talks.
Dr. Park, may I help you?
Actually, yes, do you have any
better notes on this project?
I'm having a hard time
reading your handwriting.
Oh, uh, allow me
to rephrase that.
What the hell
are you doing in my lab?
I'm sorry, I was reassigned
to this project.
I was told you were taking
a temporary sabbatical
to focus on other work.
N-No, that-that's crazy.
This is my research.
Oh, Amy, there you are.
No, not...
Not now, Sheldon, I'm dealing
with an epic screwup,
and when I find out
who's responsible,
they're gonna get an earful.
All right, well,
when you're done, let me know,
I've got some exciting news.
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
President Siebert said
you were focusing on
some important physics work
and I should take over
your lab in the interim.
Uh, hey, that was
my exciting news.
All right, I'm gonna
tell you again.
Pretend you haven't heard it.
You got me removed
from my own project?
Yeah, and it wasn't easy.
Apparently, you're very
difficult to replace.
Hey, just between you and me,
they consider Dr. Park
quite the step down.
I was trying to pick my moment
to leave. This seems like it.
Wow. Banker's hours.
No wonder you're not
on the tenure track.
Sheldon, you had no right.
What-- I thought you said
you were spread too thin.
You said that you wished
you had more time to focus
on our research.
I thought I was helping.
Well, you're not.
I mean, I have years
invested in this work,
and now someone's gonna
come in and take it over?
I mean, how would you feel
if I let Leonard take over
your super-asymmetry project?
(laughs)
That's funny.
Oh, he'd be like a puppy
with a microscope. (laughs)
(chuckles)
If I had a nickel for every time
a charity sent me a nickel.
Really? That's gonna be
our whole life, huh?
If my father's any guide,
around 50,
I start to lose my hearing
and get two new jokes.
(knock on door)
Hey.
Hey.
I brought Chinese.
Oh, that's a nice surprise.
What's the occasion?
Please, I don't need a reason
to bring food to my friends.
But you have one, don't you?
Yeah, I need your help.
All right, lay it on us.
So, I folded,
and I told Howard
he could be a part
of my planetarium show.
And now I'm worried
he's just gonna
make the whole thing
about himself.
So just tell him
you changed your mind
and you don't
want him to do it.
No, no, then he's gonna think
I'm too insecure
to share the spotlight with him.
And he'd be right.
I came here
for your support.
Well, then, you just walked up
three flights of stairs
for nothing.
Wait, don't you mean
four flights?
No, it's actually three.
But we're on the fourth floor.
I mean, you have the lobby,
first floor,
second, third, fourth.
The lobby's the first floor,
so lobby, second, third, fourth.
That does not seem right.
Hello...
Sorry, Raj, who cares if
Howard tries to steal the show?
All right? You're great
at what you do.
Just be the bigger man.
And if it makes you feel better,
Penny and I will come
so you'll have a couple of
friendly faces in the audience.
Thank you.
That would be nice.
Can you just...
Sorry, give me a minute?
Hey, Raj, if I had a nickel
for every time
a charity sent me a nickel...
That's hilarious!
I know.
(exhales)
It's three, right?
Just shut up.
Oh, good,
we caught you.
Yes, good.
You had no right
to reassign my project.
Yeah, no right at all.
Dr. Fowler,
I don't understand.
Dr. Cooper assured me
this is what you wanted.
Oh-oh! Can you
believe this guy?
Oh, sure,
so a couple of men get together
behind closed doors
to decide the fate
of a woman's career.
I thought we'd
moved past this.
Sheldon, this is
your fault.
Ooh, sounds like
the old lady's
putting me in the
doghouse tonight.
Dr. Fowler,
you are very important
to this university
and I would like
to sincerely apologize.
So I can have
my project back?
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.
Why not?
Well, in order
to free up personnel...
Hey, hey, don't go
mansplaining things to her.
I don't think that's
what he was doing.
Oh, then perhaps
you don't understand.
See, mansplaining is when
a man explains things
to a woman like
she's stupid.
Boop.
So when was the last time
you saw Howard in his
astronaut uniform?
About a week ago.
Really? What was
the occasion?
Date night.
We do a little role-playing.
What role
do you play?
(Russian accent):
I am Ykatarina Nazdorovya,
lonely Russian cosmonaut
who is expert at physics
and making love.
Okay, that just made
the next hour really weird.
Good evening,
I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,
and usually I take you on a trip
through the stars,
but tonight,
we'll begin our journey
much closer to home, 220 miles
straight up to
the International Space Station,
which is manned by a team
of brave men and women.
(Russian accent):
Flexible men and women.
Switch with me.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
And we are fortunate
to have one of those men
here with us tonight.
Please welcome to
the Griffith Observatory
astronaut Howard Joel Wolowitz.
Kak horosho.
What is she ta...
Don't ask.
Thank you, Raj, that was
a really nice introduction.
Well, it's from my heart.
So, Howard, you are
in an elite group.
Only 232 people
have ever been on
the International Space
Station. How does that
make you feel?
Honestly, lucky.
Most astronauts have to
train their whole lives.
I was just in the right
place at the right time.
Oh, please, luck had
nothing to do with it.
You people need to know
how impressive
this man is.
He was up there
because he's the
only one qualified
to install a piece of
equipment that he designed.
Thanks, but if you want
to talk impressive,
this guy right here
discovered a planetary object
outside the
Kuiper belt.
He worked on
the Mars rover.
He helped launch the
New Horizons space probe.
He went to space
on a Russian rocket.
And I was scared
the whole time.
And I was scared for you,
but also proud.
Wow.
I don't think you've ever
said that to me before.
I should have,
and I'm gonna
say it again.
I'm proud of you.
You're my best friend,
and I love you.
Aw, Raj,
I love you, too.
What is happening?
Bring it in, spaceman,
you've been cleared for landing.
Can you believe these two...
Are you crying?
(crying)
Hello, Sheldon.
Hello, Arthur.
Now, I'm confused, usually when
you appear to me in my dreams,
we're on the planet Dagobah.
This is Dagobah.
I didn't know that Dagobah
had delicatessens.
Not good ones.
Whatever you do,
don't order the Reuben.
I'm having a problem
in my marriage.
I've upset my wife and I don't
know how to make it right.
(chuckles) And you're... and
you're coming to me for advice?
I-I upset my wife every time
I woke up in the morning.
I'm not coming to you,
you're just a manifestation
of my subconscious.
I mean,
I'm actually coming to me.
So you know everything
I'm going to say.
Yes, but it sounds
wiser from you
because you're old and glowing.
Fine.
Rule number one
in a marriage:
don't go to bed angry.
That makes sense.
Rule number two in a marriage:
if you don't recognize
the shoes under your bed,
they're not your shoes.
Because they're her shoes?
(sighs) N-Never mind,
just-just go with
rule number one.
Thank you, Arthur.
Uh, before you go,
can I ask you a question?
Of course.
Does this look lean to you?
I ordered lean.
Amy. Wake up. Amy.
What? What's wrong?
We can't go to sleep
angry with each other.
Why not?
It's rule number one.
I'd tell you rule number two,
but it's confusing.
Sheldon,
go to sleep.
Amy. Amy. Amy.
You cut that out!
Oh, good, you're up.
Sheldon...
I just really don't want to talk
to you about this right now.
That's fine.
I just need
you to know
that I feel terrible
about what I did
and I wasn't
being malicious.
No, you were being selfish.
You're being selfish right now
'cause it's really late
and I just want to sleep.
No, Professor Proton
came to me in my dream
and said we can't
go to sleep angry.
Are you sure
that's what he said?
Close your eyes,
double-check.
Amy, this is
important.
Okay, listen to me.
I love working with you,
but you have to understand
how scary this is for me.
Why?
Because I don't want to get lost
in this relationship.
And when you pulled me
off my project,
it seemed like my biggest
fear was coming true,
the-the things that are mine
are getting subsumed
into the things
that are ours.
I wouldn't want that
to happen, either.
Thank you for explaining
and for using
the word ""subsume,""
that's one you
don't hear enough.
You're welcome.
Good night.
Good night.
What are you
doing now?
Looking for shoes.
Why?
When your favorite ghost tells
you to do something, you do it."
s12ep4.xml,"Hey, whatcha doing?
Improving
our wedding photos.
Oh, that's nice.
Wait, I'm still in them, right?
And not only you.
Of course.
I've added some guests
who couldn't be there.
Who's that next
to my father?
The Wright brothers.
And why are they at our wedding?
Orville, because I admire him;
Wilbur, because he was
Orville's plus-one.

Oh.
from someone named Tam.
You got an e-mail
Tam? What does
he
want?

looks like he's coming to give
his son a tour of Caltech.
He's hoping you guys

He would like that, wouldn't he?

Well, that is the gist
of the e-mail.
Who's Tam?
He was my best friend
in the whole world growing up.
heard you mention him before?

I'm sure I've mentioned him,

Hey, did you guys know
that Sheldon had
a best friend growing up
named Tam?
Was that the imaginary
talking koala?
who apparently betrayed him.
No. He's a real person
Yeah, so did the koala.
I tried to ask him
about it,
and he invoked section three,

of the marriage contract:
I can't pry.

I have to respect his wishes.

not talk to him for 20 years.

I'm pumping!
It's Penny.
Oh. Come in.
I thought you were pumping.
I thought you were my boss.
Okay, listen, I'm really worried
about this whole Raj thing.
I know,
to get married, which is weird,
he's so desperate
I know, right? You know,
we make it look that great.
because I can't imagine
gonna be around, I think
if this woman's
we should check her out
a little.
I looked online.
She doesn't have an Instagram,
or something's wrong with her.

Maybe he can get some
to do a background

Of course.
Would he do that?
who plays by his own rules.
He's a retired cop
Hi, Daddy.
No, everything's good.
I just have a favor to ask.
Yeah, so, my friend Raj
is marrying this woman
that he barely knows,
and I wanted to see if you
could use your connections
to dig up any dirt on her.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
Okay. Love you.
Absolutely not. He won't do it.
It's totally illegal.
Is he in?
he played by his own rules.
I thought you said
He does, but apparently,
they're very similar
to the actual rules.
Sheldon had a best friend
I still can't believe
heard about.
we've never
Ooh, somebody's
jealous.
Leonard,
I'm not jealous.
it's okay to be vulnerable.
this is a safe space--
All I'm saying is
of a fellow's bowel movements,
you know the timing
you don't think there's
a lot left to discover.
I wonder what Tam
could have done.
Hmm. Well, if Sheldon doesn't
want to talk about it,
pretty upsetting.
it's got to be
I have his brother George's
number-- he might know.
You have George's number?
Really?
So so
jealous.
Yeah, sure, I remember Tam,
Sheldon's little Vietnam buddy.
always running around together.
The two of them were
So, what happened?
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, Sheldon
never talks about him.
They haven't spoken in years.
He wasn't at the wedding.
He wasn't?
this is embarrassing,
All right, well,
'cause I had a long conversation
who I thought was Tam.
with someone
Wait, wait, so you don't know
what their fight was about?
I wish I could help you, boys.
Sheldon used to keep
But, you know,
when he was a kid.

Oh, he still does.
Really? I figured
that went the same way
as his bathroom schedule.
If you mean digitized, annotated
and put online, it did.
Maybe that'll tell you
something.

if I'm still on there

for peeing
Eh, you know what,
just leave it.
(laughs) See ya, boys.
Bye.
All right,
got his enemies list.
Bye.
Ooh, he updated
the interface.
You can search
by first name,
last name or length of grudge.
Is Tam on it?
Let's see.
Yep. Right here.
Tam Nguyen.
Hold on.
Oh, great. What did he do?
to the terms of service.
I have to agree
No, I'm not a robot.
Okay.
""Which of these are plants?""
And we're in.
Great. What-what
does it say?
Well...
""He knows what he did.""
Oh, come on.
(chuckles):
wait, if Tam knows
Wait. Wait, wait,
can just ask him.
what he did, we
He's gonna be on campus tomorrow
showing his son around.
Won't that make Sheldon mad?
Everything makes
Sheldon mad.
Yeah.
Look at his list.

giant yellow bird on television

Oh, this is so nice.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe instead of introducing
ourselves to Anu,
we could just get a room,
order some food and take a nap.
for that line before.
Yeah, I've fallen
It never leads
to napping.
That must be her.
Oh. She's cute.
Okay, I got you two seats
to
Hamilton
tonight.
Your tickets will be
at the concierge desk.
Of course.
My pleasure.
May I help you?
Yes, I'm here to pick up
our
Hamilton
tickets.
Stop.
Hi. We're Raj's friends.
This is Bernadette.
I'm Penny.
introduce ourselves.
We just came by to
So you came to check me out?
She's smart.
I like her.
We just want to see
if we could take you
to dinner
and get to know you a bit.
How about tonight after work?
That sounds nice.
Maybe we can go to Bavel.
Oh, I wish. That place is
impossible to get into.
Getting into impossible places
Oh, please.
is my superpower.
BERNADETTE:
Me, too.
I can fit my whole body
in our dryer.
All set. 8:30.
we'll see you tonight.
Wow. Okay, well,
See you then.
Okay.
Bye.
She can get
into any restaurant,
but the best husband
she can find is Raj?
Not Tam.
Not Tam.
Not Tam.
Got him.
Tam Nguyen?
Yeah. Yes.
Is my son done
with his tour?
No idea. We're actually
friends of Sheldon Cooper.
to get in touch with him,
Oh, I've been trying
but I never heard back.
Is he okay?
Well, if you mean
physically, yes.
If you mean
every other way, no.
LEONARD:
Uh, no.
So, is he here?
He-he didn't come.
He's, uh...
he's still pretty
upset about...
you know.
I know what?
Come on,
you-you must know.
No, we haven't talked in,
like, 20 years.
Right. Because...
you know.
I don't think
he knows.
What are you guys talking about?
Why did you and Sheldon
stop being friends?
What did you do?
And don't worry,
even though we
just met you,
we think you're right
and he's wrong.
I didn't do anything.
and we just drifted apart.
He moved to California,
Oh, come on, there's
got to be something...
Oh, hey, Sheldon.
What is going on here?
We just met...
Sheldon! So good to see you!
Tam.
It's been a long time.
to erase the sting of betrayal.
Mm, not long enough
How did I betray you?
You know what you did.
catch you up.
Uh, let me
He does not.
When I moved to California,
what did you do?
I stayed in Texas.
Do you believe this guy?!
So, he was your best friend
growing up?
Yes.
Were there no other kids
in Texas?
Hey. What is
going on with you?
Well,
I don't want to talk about it.
a perfectly stupid reason.
I'm sure you have
I don't do anything
for a stupid reason.
Talk Like a Pirate Day,
Except, perhaps,
more whimsical than stupid.
and I'd argue that's
You know, I was curious to find
out what Tam had done wrong.
Why am I not surprised
the answer is nothing?
So you're taking his side.
You scurvy dog.
There is room on my enemies list
You watch yourself.
now that the cafeteria ladies
finally told me
what's in the chili.
By the way, don't eat the chili.
Wai-Wai-Wait, you know what?
Do.
Be careful, Sheldon.
to lose a second best friend.
I don't think you can afford
I don't see anyone lining up
to be your third.
D... Wait.

No, LeBron Kershenbaum.

Why am I fighting this?
I dunno, I married for love

Oh, yeah, me, too.

Hi.
Howard, today
is your lucky day.
Leonard's out, you're my new
best friend.

Well, I'm not
but here we are.
Okay, fine.
Is Bernadette there?
Sh... No.
Just Stuart?
Let me call you back.
Let me guess.
This thing with Tam escalated,
and now you're mad at Leonard

and looking for
You know me so well.
It's too bad you can't be
my best friend.
I can be.
You can't be my wife
and my best friend.
Who would I complain
about you to?
Just tell me what happened.
Leonard talked to Tam behind
my back and took his side.
And after what he did to me.
Can you believe it?
No. I'm-I'm shocked
and outraged.
I'm shocked and outraged.
Now, tell me why
Fine.
When I got accepted
to grad school at Caltech,
I was afraid to move
so far away from home.
So Tam said
he'd move out here with me
and be my roommate.
Then,
over the summer,
he got a girlfriend,
even after reading
all the pamphlets
I gave him
about social diseases.
gave me those pamphlets.
Aw, I remember when you
Anyway, Tam stayed
with her in Texas,
and I had to move out here
all by myself.
That must've been scary.
It was.
I was lonely, and I thought
I'd never make a friend again.
And for a long time, I didn't.
But then you did.
And great friends.
If you think about it, if Tam
had moved out here with you,
who knows what your life
would've been like.
Yes.
Uh, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.
I called you
about the apartment.
You said...
You already have a roommate.
Tell him to go away.

Oh, hi.
Hi.

Oh.
That is so cool.
By the way, do not tell Raj
that you met Britney Spears,
because he will literally die.
We've been talking so much
about me,
tell me about Raj.
Okay, are you trying
to get us drunk
so we'll dish on
our friend?
'Cause it's totally gonna work,
what do you want to know?
What kind of guy is he?
He is great.
Mm-hmm.
So great.
How come he's still single?
So great. Yeah.
He's great.
Come on.
There's really nothing
to tell.
Raj is so much fun
to hang out with.
He's like one
of our girlfriends.
And I mean that in a good way.
But also a bad way.
Anything else?
No.
No.
I mean, h-he
takes baths with his dog,
but not in a weird way.
they both wear swimsuits.
Or a normal way;
He also cries every time

But he is great.
Yeah.
So great.

Hello, Sheldon.
Thank you for coming.
Hello Tam.
I just want you to know
that, um...
I forgive you.
I didn't do anything.
And yet, here I am,
still being the bigger man.
Look, I was in love with Beth,
and she made me happy.
Y... Really?
Did
she
let you play
with her train set?
In a manner of speaking.
Sheldon, I needed
to stay in Texas.
And you needed
to come here.
I knew you were gonna
do amazing things,
and meet amazing people
who were gonna respect you,
because you're brilliant.
And because they never had to
fish you out of a dumpster.
but it was during
Well, they have,
my short-lived parkour phase.
I didn't mean to upset you.
And I want you to know
I'm really proud
of everything you've done.
Thank you.
It did work out for me.
And I'm sorry that things
didn't work out for you.
They did work out for me.

Oh, Tam, you don't need
I'm not.
I have a great wife
and amazing children.
I'm very happy.
Brave, brave Tam.

Yeah.
Of course.

Yep.

Cool.

Sure.

s11ep24.xml,"All right, Saturday is the big day.
A lot of people thought this would never come.
I may have been one of those people.
-I may have been one of those people.
-Wait, are we talking about the wedding?
-Yes.
-I was definitely one of those people.
Yet here we are. We got a lot of family
coming in tomorrow, I need everyone's help.
Think of this as one of your
comic book movies.
There's superheroes,
each with a different task.
-Oh, like the new
Avengers.
-Which one was that?
The one you slept through last weekend.
Oh. That was a good nap.
I think it's more like
Lord of the Rings
and you're the Fellowship.
Someone's gotta go to Gondor,
someone's gotta go to Mordor...
...gotta hold off the demon
of shadow and flame.
-You mean the Balrog?
-I mean my mother.
-That is a perfect metaphor, Amy.
-Thank you.
Because it also involves a ring
that binds me in servitude forever.
He said forever.
That was Wil Wheaton.
He's really excited about tomorrow.
As am I.
If you'd have told me as a child
that an actor from
Star Trek
...
...would be officiating my wedding,
I would've said, ""Ooh. William Shatner?""
If you'd have said, ""No, Wil Wheaton,""
I would've said:
""Did you even try William Shatner?""
If you said, ""Yes, he costs
too much money,"" I would've said:
""Well, Wil Wheaton's good too.""
Why do you keep tying and untying
that bow tie?
-I can't seem to get it even.
-I don't think it's supposed to be even.
Sometimes a little asymmetry looks good.
In the Renaissance, they called it sprezzatura.
The Renaissance?
Amy, you know I'm more of
an Enlightenment person.
At some point we'll have to decide
how we want to raise the children.
So are you feeling okay?
-No wedding jitters?
-No.
There is nothing in the world that would
stop me from marrying you tomorrow.
Even me from the future coming back
to prevent the wedding...
...and the subsequent birth of a child
who will destroy humanity.
If you came from the future, that means
you already went through with the wedding...
...because you believe that time travel
is on a closed loop.
I love you so damn much.
[MR. FOWLER SIGHS]
Mr. Fowler, you okay back there?
Do you need more air?
He's fine.
I'm surprised Amy didn't pick us up.
Oh, well, you know, she's pretty busy
the day before her wedding.
Too busy for her mother?
She used to be such a devoted daughter.
Now she's just waiting for me to die
so she can get my china.
-Thank you again for picking us up.
-My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.
You know, our driver to the airport
was also an Indian fellow.
Mom.
Oh, so now it's racist to notice
when somebody's Indian?
I don't think it's racist.
I noticed you were both white.
See?
You'll have to excuse her,
she's just pregnant and hormonal.
Oh, yeah, congratulations
on baby number two.
Yeah, whoopee.
Her husband would be here, but he
stayed home to watch their older son.
So everything's fine.
Stop it. We're separated.
You don't say.
So you're Sheldon's big brother.
Yeah. He got the brains, I got the bod. Heh.
And the face and the hair.
I like your accent.
Sheldon, did you used to sound like that?
Can you still?
I can. I will not.
Amy, you said something about my bow tie
that I can't stop thinking about.
Don't you mean:
[IN SOUTHERN ACCENT]
""Y'all said something about my bow tie""?
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Go on, say it.
Say it.
Hey, guys, look who I have.
-Hey, guys. Hey, Shelly.
-I'm so glad you made it, Missy.
This is my fiancée, Amy.
Amy, this is my sister.
If I ever need a kidney,
this is where you get it.
It's so nice to meet you.
I've always wanted a sister.
Really, why?
-I love you too, Sheldon.
-Really, why?
Where's Mom?
She wanted to stop by the hotel
and freshen up...
...and then call her pastor to pray
for Missy's soul.
Oh, my God.
-There's mama's girl.
-Hi, Mom.
Larry, look at her.
Can you believe our little lamb
is finally getting married?
He can't believe it...
...and neither can I. Ha-ha-ha.
Hi, Dad. How you doing?
What the hell is that?
Come on, you know this one. It's a dog.
I found him in the backyard.
Don't worry, I called the owner.
Good, because we don't need a dog.
We already have two babies, you, and Stuart.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
That's probably him.
Hi.
I'm gonna need a minute.
That's Mark Hamill!
Hello.
Oh, thank you so much for finding this guy.
Oh, my goodness.
Hey, Bark, how are you, buddy?
Your dog's name is Bark?
Yeah.
Bark Hamill?
Yeah. Well, I let the fans name him online.
I got lucky though.
He was almost Honey-Baked Hamill.
Anyway, thanks so much.
-I wanna give you a reward for finding him.
-Oh, no, I couldn't take your money.
It's just an honor to meet you.
No, no, please.
You don't know what this dog means to me.
And I thought he was gone for good.
Please?
There must be something I can do for you.
Anything.
Oh, you're gonna regret that.
-Hey, dude.
-Dude?
Yeah, you know, just want you to know
that I don't think of you as a woman.
Oh, perfect. I don't think of you as a man.
Great. So as two genderless blobs
of human flesh...
...how would you like to go to
Sheldon and Amy's wedding with me?
Oh, Stuart.
Look, I appreciate that, but just might be
a little weird considering you're my boss--
Guess who's gonna officiate
Sheldon and Amy's wedding. Mark Hamill.
Luke Skywalker is gonna be at the wedding!
You'll need to buy me a dress.
And did you know that my Amy played
Amelia Earhart in the eighth grade?
You never said you were in a school play.
Oh, no, no, at home.
I'd never let her do a school play.
Those kids just take drugs
and have intercourse.
And, you know,
Amy still does some performing.
She and Sheldon do an Internet show
about flags.
Amy?
Videos on the Internet?
You know what men use those for.
If you're talking about Fun with Flags,
I use it to go to sleep.
Sheldon, you're awfully quiet.
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm sorry,
I was thinking about string theory.
Catch me up, what'd I miss?
Are you seeing this, Larry?
These are the people I'm gonna have
to live with after you're dead.
Welcome, Bert. Don't you look nice?
Yeah, like a geode, I clean up good.
-Don't you crack a geode open?
-It's not a perfect metaphor.
-Oh, my God, is that Mark Hamill?
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God, is that--?
-Bert, go find your seat!
-What is he doing here?
-I found his dog and guilted him...
...into officiating.
Don't tell Sheldon, it's a surprise.
-I thought Wil was officiating the wedding.
-Yeah, so did he.
-How did he take the news?
-I'll let you know.
Hey, Wil.
Are you having an allergic reaction
to my boutonniere?
No, I'm just so happy for you.
And for me.
After today, you are officially and,
more important, legally...
...Amy's problem.
Don't be silly, Leonard.
I will always be your problem.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
-Hey, baby.
-Hello, Mother.
-Leonard, could you give us a moment?
-Oh, of course.
Oh, Shelly.
-I wish your dad could see you now.
-Me too.
I miss him.
He would be so proud of you.
I know that I am.
Thank you.
I mean, for everything.
My whole life.
[CHUCKLES]
-Let me straighten your tie.
-No, no, no, it's all right.
It's supposed to be a little asymmetrical.
-Apparently a small flaw somehow improves it.
-I can see that.
Sometimes it's the imperfect stuff...
...that makes things perfect.
Excuse me.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Case in point.
So we finally meet.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Heh. I'm Wil Wheaton.
I was supposed to officiate this wedding.
I was up all night preparing these notes.
Well, thanks so much.
This is gonna be a great help.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
SHELDON:
Amy. Amy. Amy.
-Come in.
-There's something I need to tell you.
Wow, you look amazing!
That's not what I need to tell you,
but you do.
-What's wrong?
-Something incredible just happened.
Remember when you were telling me about my
bow tie and how a little asymmetry is good?
-Yeah.
-My equations...
...have been trying to describe
an imperfect world.
And the only way to do that is to introduce
imperfection into the underlying theory.
So instead of supersymmetry,
it would be super asymmetry?
Super asymmetry, that's it!
-Give me lipstick.
-What?
Give it to me, beautiful thing.
We have work to do.
Hey. The bride and groom seem to be
running a little behind.
-Do you think you could stall?
-Stall? How?
Hey, everybody,
it's gonna be a few more minutes.
But while we wait, does anyone have
any questions about
Star Wars?
You got this!
So if I make slightly asymmetric knots
with sheets in four dimensions...
...I can bootstrap the whole idea to
a large asymmetry in 11 dimensions.
Maybe even at the initial moment of creation,
the fundamental forces lacked symmetry.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
-Everyone's waiting, what are you guys doing?
-Super asymmetry.
-Super asymmetry? Is that a thing?
-We're inventing it right now.
Don't you think this can wait until--?
Hold on, this is interesting.
So yeah, Mr. Mark?
When you were on the Wookiee
home planet...
...how did you even understand
what they were saying?
I don't remember ever being
on a Wookiee home planet.
Actually Luke was on the Wookiee home planet
Kashyyyk in the holiday special...
...when he helped Chewie
get home to his wife.
Chewie had a wife?
Her name's Malla.
Wow, that's impressive.
Yeah.
Hey, I got a question.
Why aren't there tires
on any of the
Star Wars
vehicles?
I'm sure some of them had tires.
Actually, they don't.
I mean, the HAVw A5 turbo tank
has metal gripping wheels...
...but I wouldn't call them tires.
You are so hot.
This is taking too long.
I bet that Sheldon stood my baby up.
Excuse me, where are you going?
This whole thing was a big mistake.
-I'm gonna find Amy and get her out of here.
-Sit down.
Excuse me?
Sheldon loves Amy and he'd never hurt her
on her wedding day...
...or any other day. So park it.
Oh, you sit down too.
Are you gonna let her talk to me like that?
Say something.
Thank you.
According to Google, there are zero papers
that mention super asymmetry.
This is brand new, no one's thought of it.
What are you lunatics doing?
-Sheldon had a breakthrough.
-Actually, Amy and I had a breakthrough.
Oh, science? Shocking.
-You don't understand, this could be really big.
-No, Penny's right.
We have our whole lives
to do science together.
Let's get married.
All right. It's go time, I am pumped!
Okay, everyone, here we go.
Leonard.
That's Mark Ha-- Ha-- Ha....
It's Mark Ham.... Ha....
Yep. Thank Wolowitz, he set it up.
Congratulations on your wedding.
Thank you.
When this is over,
I have 4,000 things for you to sign.
[""BRIDAL CHORUS"" PLAYING]
Thank you, Daddy.
I thought Wil was marrying us.
Wolowitz got us an upgrade.
Another sci-fi guy with a beard.
Seems lateral, but okay.
Welcome.
We are gathered here today in the sight
of family, friends and almighty God.
That's too religious.
That lady over there made me say it.
He heard you and he can't unhear you.
We're here to celebrate the marriage
of Sheldon Lee Cooper...
...and Amy Farrah Fowler.
I had more prepared, but I'm just
gonna skip to the rings and vows...
...since I've been answering your questions
for 45 minutes.
Yeah, he answered them.
Amy, you're up.
Sheldon...
...when I was a little girl,
I used to dream about my wedding.
But eventually I stopped because
I thought that day would never come.
And then I met you.
From the first moment in that coffee shop...
...I knew that there was something special
between us...
...even though I did work on a study
that disproved love at first sight.
I loved that study the moment I read it.
Ironic, huh?
Clearly it was wrong...
...because I felt something that day...
...and those feelings have only
gotten stronger with time.
I can't imagine loving you more
than I do right now...
...but I felt that way yesterday
and the day before yesterday...
...and the day before that.
Is that growth linear or accelerating?
-Accelerating.
-Oh, maybe we can graph it out.
-Save something for the honeymoon.
-Smart.
Sheldon.
I don't know what the future holds...
...but I know that I've never been happier
than I am...
...in this moment marrying you.
Well, that was unexpectedly beautiful.
I might need a minute.
Amy.
I usually know exactly what to say...
...but in this moment...
...I have no words.
I guess...
...I'm overwhelmed by you.
In a good way...
...not in the elevator in
the Haunted Mansion way.
Even if I can't tell you now how I feel...
...I will spend my life showing you
how much I love you.
Do you--?
[CLEARS THROAT]
Do you--?
Hey, I'm just saying,
I'm here if you need me to step in.
No, no, no, I got this.
Amy, do you take Sheldon for your
lawful wedded husband?
I do.
[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
And Sheldon, same thing?
I do.
Then by the power vested in me
by even-you-can-perform-weddings.com...
...I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

Wouldn't it be easier to text him?
It isn't just to alert Batman.
It also strikes fear in his enemies...
-...and lets them know he's coming.
-Like Sheldon's knock. Heh.
Comparing me to Batman? I'll take it.
If we don't do anything,
how long will they talk about Batman?
Well, I've known them for 11 years,
so 11 years.
I think they text him.
The signal's linked to his phone via Bluetooth.
-Is that in the comics?
-Nah, it's just what I believe.
-All right, I'm putting a stop to this.
-If you knew how, why'd you wait 11 years?
Hey, guys, guess what.
Today at work, I found out
I am going to meet Bill Gates.
-Really?
HOWARD: Sorry, Leonard.
You and Penny had a good run.
-I'm not leaving him for Bill Gates.
-You sure? I bet his Internet's really fast.
How did this happen?
His foundation's looking for a pharmaceutical
company to develop affordable vaccines.
-So I'll be showing him around.
-That's great. When?
He gets in on Sunday, and Monday morning
I'm giving him a tour of the labs and offices.
Oh. He gets in on Sunday, April 1st? Heh.
Nice try, Penny.
-What are you talking about?
-April Fools' Day.
Another one of your pranks
you try to pull on me.
I've literally never pulled a prank on you.
What about that e-mail you sent me with the
photo attached, but you didn't attach a photo?
That was a mistake.
Messing with me? Yes, it was.
And this year, I'm not falling for it.
-Sheldon, I swear--
-Ah. What are you doing?
Oh. You're right. He's not coming. April Fools.
Fool me N times, where N equals
the amount of times you've already fooled me...
...shame on you.
Fool me N plus one times, shame on me.
So you're gonna spend a day with Bill Gates.
-I'm a little jealous.
-I'm nervous.
If I do a good job, I'm hoping
they'll consider me for a PR position.
Well, if you're nervous, I know a lot about him.
I can fill you in, or come along, whatever.
I think I'll be okay.
What'll you do if he wants to talk about
language interpreters for microcomputers?
What are language interpreters
for microcomputers?
A way of programming using words
instead of binary code.
Oh, that's interesting. Tell me more.
-Oh, well--
-That. I'll do that.
-I didn't even see it coming.
-Yeah, well, you never do.
Look, it's just he's an idol of mine.
I would love the chance to hang out with him.
I know, but I can't turn this into a social thing.
It's my job. I need it to go well.
I get it. I get it. You're right.
I met him once before. He gave a talk
at Princeton and my mom took me.
-Oh, really? Was he nice?
-He was super nice.
I got pretty emotional
and started crying and....
-He didn't make fun of me or anything.
-Well, you were a kid.
Uh-huh.
Bye, my babies. I love you.

-No problem.
Can I get you anything? Juice box, naners?

-Bob the Builder.
I'll catch you up.
That one's Bob.
He's a builder.
Isn't this a kids' show?
It's what we watch in this house.
Bob the Builder, Dinosaur Train

-Sure.

A streetlight's been knocked over.
-Why does it not feel like we're going?
-Hang on. I just wanna see if Bob can fix it.
Can you fix it?
BOB:
Yes, I can.
-Heh. Yes, he can.
-Oh, hey.
-I folded your laundry for you. You're welcome.
That's not mine.
You're saying that these aren't yours?
No.
So you're saying
I'm touching a stranger's underpants?
Yes.
And just like that,
it's the worst day of my life.
Okay, why are you being so weird?
It occurred to me that perhaps...
...you were telling the truth about Bill Gates
and it wasn't part of a prank.
What would the prank part be?
I show up to meet Bill Gates over
your ""objections,"" but it's not Bill Gates at all.
It's one of those look-a-likes
you hire for a party.
When I show everybody the balloon animal
""Bill Gates"" made for me, I look like an idiot.
Have you been eating laundry detergent?
I need you to tell me the truth.
This is driving me crazy.
-Sheldon, he is really coming.
-Is he?
-He is.
-Really?
Yeah.
Now I don't know what to believe.
Thanks for taking me out.
-I feel like my brain is turning to mush.
-Happy to help.
-Did I show you the video of the kids sitting?
-Yes, you texted it to me at 3 a.m. Heh.
I thought someone was either
in jail or dead. Heh.
-I'm sorry.
-No, no. It gave me something to watch...
...while I tried to go back to sleep.
I don't wanna be a mom
who can only talk about her kids.
Well, I'm reading a pretty good book.
It's the untold story
of female artists during the Renaissance.
I'm in the middle of a book too.
It's three pages long and floats in the bath.
-We can talk about something else.
-It quacks when you squeeze it.
You should've seen Michael laugh.
I think I have a video.
Or maybe we can't.
Why is your screen name John Williams?
Uh, because I always score.
-Hey, I'm heading to the office for a bit.
-On a Sunday?
Yeah. I wanna make sure
I'm prepared for tomorrow.
Think you could get Bill Gates
to sign something?
-Yeah, maybe. Like what?
-My arm, my chest, his call.
His call will be to the police.
Penny, remember when I introduced you
to 100 calorie Dove Bars...
...and you said you owed me, like, bigtime?
Guys, even if I wanted to introduce you,
there's no time. Look at this itinerary.
I meet him at his hotel tomorrow morning,
and we're on the go all day long.
-Guys, this is her job. We need to respect that.
-Thanks, honey.
-Proud of you.
-Love you.
I totally just saw what hotel he's staying at.
-What are we waiting here for?
-For Penny to get to her car and drive away.
Right. Smart.
-Is that long enough?
-She's pretty quick. Let's go.
What would you do if you had $1 billion?
Same as Bill Gates,
try to make the world a better place...
...but I'd do it in a working Iron Man suit.
I didn't know it came in a boys' medium.
This is a bad idea. We should go.
-What are you talking about?
-I'm feeling guilty.
Like I'm sneaking around
behind Penny's back.
We're just hanging out in a hotel lobby.
Plenty of people do that.
The businessmen, the high-end prostitutes.
That's a fun new game, CEO or Ho.
No, this is wrong. Let's go.
Guys, guys, that's him.
-Be cool.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Cooler.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Mr. Gates, I'm Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
We've actually met before.
Sorry, I don't remember.
You were so nice...
...and it was really special to me, because
you've been such an influence on my life.
[VOICE BREAKING] Ever since I was a kid,
I've looked up to you like a hero.
Oh, now I remember.
-Would you like a tissue?
-How about a hug? Heh.
How about a tissue?
-Sorry I talked about my kids the whole time.
-Oh, don't worry about it.
I mean, besides you cutting up my meat for me,
it was a lovely lunch.
God, what's happening?
I'm a smart, educated, successful....
Woman?
I was gonna get it.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Pregnancy and childbirth causes
physical changes to the structure of your brain.
I liked the old structure of my brain.
But then, I liked a lot of my old structures.
These are positive changes.
Studies with rats show that...
...new mothers are more sensitive
to danger, better at multi-tasking...
...and bolder in the pursuit of food.
I did stick a couple lamb chops in my purse.
So that's what I was smelling.
Even though your brain is different,
in many ways it's better.
-But were you bored?
-Of course not.
You're lying.
Which you can tell because your maternal brain
is better at sensing non-verbal cues.
-Now you're just being condescending.
-Heh. Look at you, two for two.
LEONARD:
Hold the door. Hold the door.
Oh, hi, Leonard.
Didn't you hear me yell, ""Hold the door""?
I did. But you know what they say,
""hold the door, get robbed some more.""
No one says that.
Oh. Well, they should,
because it's true and it rhymes.
So where have you been?
Actually, I met Bill Gates.
I see. You're all in on it. Nice try.
It's not an April Fools' joke, Sheldon.
I went to a hotel and met him.
Right, right. Okay, so ""Bill Gates""
was at the ""hotel"" that you ""went to.""
Why is ""went to"" in quotes?
Fine. So ""Bill Gates""
was at the ""hotel"" that you went to.
-That's you and Bill Gates.
-It is.
-Were you crying?
-No.
-So it wasn't a joke and I could have met him?
-He's probably still there.
-What hotel?
-The La Quinta Inn in Thousand Oaks...
-...under the name Hernandez.
-Thank you. Thank you so much.
April Fools.
-Hey.
-Hey. Where you been?
Hanging out with the guys.
-They mad at me?
-They were, but I was like, ""Hey.""
They were like, ""What?"" I was like, ""You know,""
and they were like, ""Okay.""
[LAUGHING]
-You're a good husband.
-It's not for me to say.
But you said it, so you're probably right.
There is a little reception for Mr. Gates
tomorrow night.
I asked if I could bring you
and they said yes.
What?
You get to meet Bill Gates again.
Wait, what do you mean ""again""?
-You met him that one time with your mom.
-Yes.
And then again tomorrow
for a total of two and only two times. Heh.
I wonder if he'll remember you.
Yeah, I wonder that too.
BERNADETTE [ON BABY MONITOR]:
The sun is losing about...
...six times 10 to the 12th
grams per second...
...so the fraction of the mass it loses every year
is about 10 to the negative 13th.
But don't worry, it'll be millions of years
before we all freeze to death.
Sweet dreams.
Wow,
Hop on Pop
took a dark turn
there at the end. Heh.
Amy made me realize that new mothers are
cognitively primed to take in new information.
I've been wasting it making up songs
about our babies' toes.
To be fair, I co-wrote ""Pinky Toe, Pinky Toe.""
Evolution gave me a mom brain
to focus on the baby.
-I figure I can hack it to learn lots of new things.
-That's great.
Yeah, there was a problem and I fixed it.
You're like Bob the Builder
in that giraffe cage.
Spoiler alert. I didn't see that one yet.
So that's fun.
You get to meet Bill Gates again.
It's not fun. I'm screwed.
It's fun for us. Heh.
-Maybe he won't remember you.
-I snotted on his tie.
Yeah, you did. Like, a lot.
Hello, Leonard. Thought I'd find you here.
You snake.
What's going on?
He sent me to Thousand Oaks
to meet Bill Gates, and he wasn't there.
What? Leonard, that's terrible.
Yeah, why would you do that? You know
he's staying at the DoubleTree in Long Beach.
Aha!
Wait. How do I know you're not tricking me?
We probably are.
But what if we're not?
You think you're so smart.
You think I'm going to fall for it again,
don't you?
Well, I won't.
-Where you going?
-Shut up.
Aww. You sure you can't come?
[IN CONGESTED VOICE]
I want to, but I'm just too sick.
-You really wanted to meet him.
-I know. I've been trying to hide it so I can go...
-...but I don't wanna make him sick.
-Yeah.
Yeah, you do look pretty pale and clammy.
Yeah.
-Have fun.
-Well, feel better, okay?
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
No, that's just my regular pale and clammy.
I mean, the bigger danger
isn't the loss of mass.
It'll run out of hydrogen to use for nuclear fuel,
swell up into a red giant and fry the Earth.
So you don't wanna split a salad?
No, thank you. Did you hear about
the light-splitting greenhouse film...
-...that can improve photosynthetic efficiency?
-No.
Just a little something I read
while nursing a human being that I made.
-I'm just gonna get the chicken.
-Ah.
N-E-K-C-I-H-C. ""Chicken"" backwards.
Boom, mom brain.
And a whole bottle of wine.
Oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oho!
In your face. Ha.
[COMPUTER CHIMING]
[IN CONGESTED VOICE]
Hello?
Aw, hey, sweetie. How you feeling?
Okay. I'm just resting.
I have a surprise to make you feel better.
-Really?
-Yeah, look who's here.
Wait, I know you.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
You were waiting for me at my hotel.
You ruined my tie.
What? What's he talking about?
Uh.... He-- Obviously, he's kidding.
That's a good one, Bill. I gotta go.
Stupid Leonard...
...meeting stupid Bill Gates...
...without stupid me.
Aww.
I am so sorry-- Sheldon?
Leonard, I can't stay mad at you.
Come here. Heh-heh.
Apology accepted.
What's for dinner? I'm starving.

It was hilarious.
Well, Sheldon didn't think so,
and neither did I.
It was all in good fun.
Oh, come on.
but Sheldon's feelings got hurt.
Well, I'm sure it was,
M-Maybe Howard could apologize?
You're kidding, right?
Sheldon didn't apologize
when he said my baby looked
like Winston Churchill.
He loves Churchill.
Your son should take that
as a compliment.
He said it about my daughter.
Well, this isn't about Sheldon.
This is about Howard.
I think it
is
about Sheldon.
of Howard for being an engineer?
How many times has he made fun
Going to MIT? His magic?
Sheldon doesn't make fun
of his magic.
Well, he should. It's stupid.
Anyway, the point is,
Sheldon shouldn't dish it out
if he can't take it.
that Howard owes him an apology.
I think the point is
Yeah, well, I think the point is
if Sheldon has a problem
with Howard,
Sheldon should take it up
with him.

Tasted weird to me.
Can't believe Amy did that.

Oh, come on.

That was totally different.
That didn't hurt my feelings.
How?
Well, for what it's worth,
a very good impression of you.
I didn't think it was
an annoying high-pitched voice?
Really? You don't think I have
No, not at all.
In fact, I find your voice
quite melodious.
Mm-hmm. And you don't think
I'm unnecessarily hurtful?
What? I'm sorry.

I just heard the music.

And I'm sorry about earlier.
It was.
I know it doesn't matter.

Okay? You were right.
It was Halloween.
I was dressed as a cat,
you were a hobbit.
It was right there
on that couch.
Why didn't you just say that?
that was our first kiss.
Because I always hated

I was drunk, and I
make myself feel better.

kiss to mean something.

We'll make that

That was beautiful.
What are you still doing here?
Mm.
I was in the bathroom.
Guacamole didn't agree with me.
you can help us clean up.
Well, since you're here,
Sure.
Will you take this out, please?
Thank you.
It's late. Would you mind
if I crashed here tonight?
You are always welcome here.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Where were we?
I think Howard hurting
my feelings has in some ways
made me a better person.
improving on perfection.
Hmm. Look at you,
How so?
As you were eating that Danish,
I wanted to point out
that the Danish
isn't Danish at all.
by Austrian bakers
It was imported
during a labor dispute
in the 1800s.
But I chose not to,
because I didn't want to be
the kind of fella
who foists unwanted facts
about European pastries
on the unwilling.
Huh. That's actually
interesting.
Sorry. Now you'll never know.
Hey, guys, I need your help.
Bernadette's still pretty upset
(chuckles):
about your costumes.
She's
upset?
Those pants I wore to make fun
of you were so tight,
I risked a testicular hernia.
Anyway,
if you guys could apologize,
it'd be a big help.
to apologize to her
Oh, we'd be happy
as soon as she apologizes to me
for not making you apologize
to Sheldon.
I didn't follow that,
but, then, between my wife
and that guacamole,
I didn't get a lot
of sleep last night.
it's unreasonable
Don't you think
something she refused to do?
for her to ask us to do
Yes. So when can you
stop by? (chuckles)
If it's unreasonable,
I don't understand.
why should we do it?
Okay, how about this?
You know in
Star Wars
were playing holochess?
when R2 and Chewbacca
Really?
Star Wars?
Amy, let the man speak.
WOLOWITZ:
Well, Chewbacca
and getting angry and...
was losing
we should let the Wookiee win?
W-W-Wait. Are you saying
(chuckles):
Hey.
you're talking about.
Hey, that's my wife
But yes, let the Wookiee win.
(whispers):
Hello, Bernadette.
Wait, did you just walk
into my house?
No, Howard let me in.
Where is he?
Oh, he got in his car
and drove away.
Oh.
Is that watermelon
for anybody?
Is she gonna eat all of it?
It's for Halley.
she looks like Churchill.
God, no wonder
What do you want, Sheldon?
your feelings were hurt.
Howard said
Well, Howard's wrong.
I don't care
if someone makes fun of me.
All right.
Apparently I came
all this way for nothing.
Unless Halley wants to share
that watermelon?
You think Amy's the first person
to make fun of me
for having a squeaky voice?
Do you?
I feel like my chance
at watermelon
is dangling by a thread.
She's not. It's been happening
my whole life.
And-and she called me out
for being mean?
Well, I've had to be mean.
It's hard to be taken seriously
the smallest person in the room.
when you're always
I know that.
when I was nine years old.
I was in high school
I tried to tell
the other kids
my physical stature was small,
that although
my intellectual stature
towered over them.
That only seemed
to make things worse.
Bernadette the marionette.
The kids called me
(laughs): Because you're small.
That's funny.
No, it's not.
Well, people used
to call me egghead
'cause there were eggs
on my head.
'Cause they threw them at me.
That's terrible.
made me breathe helium.
One time my brothers
I tried to call for help,
who could hear me was the dog.
but the only one
That's also terrible.
My goodness, you had to live
in a house with a dog.
with a lot of crap from people.
I guess we both had to put up
I suppose we have. Huh.
Maybe you and I are more alike
than we thought.
Maybe we are.
Although I'm exceptionally tall,
and you're exceptionally...
You didn't even let me finish.
Sheldon.
Fine. Sorry.
Short.
you're ready for this?
Sheldon, you sure
Please.
This movie's pretty scary.
I think I can handle it.
I'm an adult.
That's what you said about the
butterfly pavilion at the zoo.
After I pet that goat,
That was my fault.
I felt like a gladiator.
Okay, lights on, or lights off?
Lights off. If I'm gonna
do this, I want to do it right.

What do you guys think
you're doing?
Sheldon
Halloween.
We're showing
Sheldon, come home.
Absolutely not.

to watch it.

I'm gonna hook up the garden
Why does it need
running water?
it's got electricity:
Same reason
Bernadette and I both work,
and we're overcompensating.
This reminds me of a traditional
Amish barn raising.
With everyone pitching in.
How exactly are you pitching in?
I don't hear anyone else
giving facts
Amish barn raising.
about traditional
The rest of us are pitching in
with hammers and nails.
Well, facts are my nails,
and my voice is the hammer

Well, that is how it feels.

Hey, uh, can you
about Amish barn raising--
Yeah, fun fact
they don't use any power tools.
No.
Amy, make him stop.
If he tires himself out now,
he'll sleep better tonight.
BERNADETTE: Hey, Howie,
can you give me a hand?
I need to get some work done,
and the kids are climbing
all over me.
I'll watch them.
You know what?
about to tell everyone
But I was just
You sure?
why they're called
Pennsylvania Dutch
when they really hail
from Germany.
Yep.
Thanks.
So, what do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?
And when our kids outgrow it,
we can Airbnb it
to other people's babies.
Funny.
You all right?
Sorry, I haven't had
a second to myself.
inside, finish my report,
So let me just go back
brush my teeth, change
out of my pajamas,
make a sandwich,
and then I'll come out here
and laugh at your joke.
Ooh. As long as you're
making sandwiches...
at that one later, too.
You can laugh
All right, I've kept you
in suspense long enough.
""Dutch"" is a bastardization
of the word ""Deutsch,""
meaning German.

President Siebert,
(knocks)
Hey. There's my guy!
You sound like my wife
just before she asked me
to go to Coachella.
No, this is gonna be
way more fun than Coachella.
More fun than heatstroke?
Good luck.
So, there are some funds left
administrative grant,
in the general
and I need somebody to decide
how we should disburse them.
Really?
W-Wow, what an honor.
Thank you.
who gets the money?
So how do I decide
How do you decide anything?
Think about it with your brain,
and then say it with your mouth.
Yeah, right, sure.
Uh, so, after I decide,
do I then submit it to you
for approval, or...?
No. You decide,
you approve,
and then you pride yourself
on a job well done.
That's a lot of responsibility.
Well, if I didn't think
you were up to the task,
you wouldn't have been fifth
on my list.
I-I'll get started right away.
Thank you.
And I look forward
to hearing nothing about it.
I will keep you posted.
Hey, thank you guys again
No problem.
for helping out
yesterday.
It
was
fun.
That was really fun.
But I am sore.
You didn't lift a finger.
No, but I narrated
the entire event,
and I am paying for it today.
Hi.
Hey.
Gentlemen.
Leonard, do I detect
a little swagger in your step?
Mm, possibly.
It doesn't suit you.
Well, stop.
What's going on?
Well,

Siebert put me in charge
of the administrative funds,
and I have sole discretion.
Christmas came early.
Ooh! Looks like
First thing on my list
is a golden umbrella,

Uh, hold on, I'm not
There's a procedure
you need to follow.
I believe he's referring

Sure, sure. Is ""Jet Ski""

of the administrative fund.

Can't think
I think he's done this before.
I know you and I have a...
Leonard,
oh, troubled history, but I hope
that when I make my request
you'll give me a fair shot.
Of course.

Oh.
Okay. Everybody
in the sink.
Bad news, Howie.
I'm gonna be stuck at work
for a while.
Oh, that's terrible.
Hang in there.
I'll be home as soon as I can.
(sighs):
Ah...
He deserves better.
No, I'm
not
going
to reconsider.
Your request was denied.

Wow. That was

Everyone assumes I'm just gonna

Hmm. But you're not, are you?
No, I'm not.
I mean, look at this.
I don't think so. Denied!
An espresso machine?
Wow, I really like
this side of you.
Really?
Yeah, just so decisive.
Well, check this out.
A standing desk. Denied!
Oh!
If you want to stand,
do it on your own time,
'cause I'm the boss.
Yeah, you are.
Hello.
Hey.
Hey.
Leonard, I just wanted
to congratulate you on how well
this grant money.
What do you want?
you are managing
Nothing. I just came by
to pay you a compliment.
The answer's no.
Nice try.
To what? I'm not
asking you for anything.
All I need for my job
is right here. Hmm?
Which makes for a great commute.
This is my office.
Home, work, home.
I'm just working from home.
I'm still working--
You know, if it's that easy,
then why does Leonard
have to drive you
to work every day?
Because I like the frozen yogurt
machine in the cafeteria.
Ooh, I suppose I could use
a frozen yogurt machine...
Denied!
Oh, you should have seen him--
denying things left and right.
It was so sexy.
'Course, I made a request
he did
not
deny.
Uh-huh.
Are you listening to me?
You slept with your husband.
Yeah, sure.
What is going
on with you?
It's not a big thing.
Have you ever told Leonard
a little white lie?
thinks I've seen
Mm. Well, he

movies,
every one of the

That could be any of them.
Exactly.
that I've had to work late
I've been telling Howie
the past couple nights,
but really,
I've just been hiding out
in Halley's playhouse.
Does that make me awful?
Awful? No.
Uh, strange? Yes.
Sad? A little, yes.
It's just that work's
been crazy, and the minute
I get home, I have two kids
and sometimes I don't want
hanging on me,
and pinching my belly fat.

That'd be a good slogan
for a condom company.

I love my kids,
just makes me feel human again.

So, you go home
in the backyard?
Yeah!
did you have a chance
Oh, Dr. Hofstadter,
I did,
to look over my proposal?
and your research
is fascinating.
I had no idea that crows
were that smart.
Do they really hold grudges?

They do. One
from my behavioral
study a year ago.

you might make a decision?

Because I have
how to open the locks.

When I came in to my lab
this morning,
they suddenly got silent.

I think they're
Um, soon. I've narrowed it
down to three projects.
Ooh, is mine one
of them?
Actually, yeah.

The software in

hasn't been
and it seems like
it might be time.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
(chuckles)
So you're just gonna give
the money to your friend?
I smell a rat.
I work with rats, too.
That might be me.
I'm not just giving it
to my friend, Barry.
Your proposal is
also in the mix.
Wait, so those
are the three?
even considering mine?
You're not
Why, because they're PhDs
and I'm just an engineer?
No, because they wrote
detailed proposals,
of the guy from
Jerry Maguire
and you sent a YouTube clip
saying, ""Show me
the money!""
KRIPKE:
All right, Hofstadter,
what's it gonna be?
Which project
are you gonna pick?
Yeah, come on, Leonard.
Tell us now.
LEE: But, remember,
crows aren't the only ones
who can hold a grudge.
proposals have a lot of merit.
Look, all three of your
I'm making the right decision.
I just want to make sure
I can tell you're stressed.
I withdraw my proposal.
If it helps,
It doesn't help.
Fine. Then I'm back in the mix.
Show me the money!
Okay, I-I just--
I need everyone
to back off.

I'm in charge here, and I'll
When will that be?
(groans)
A day, a week.
I don't know!
Where are you going?
I don't know that either!
Ooh.
Someone's
making decisions.
I'm reviewing these proposals.
Yeah. 'Cause you're
the boss man,
telling people what's what.
I like it.
It's just so hard!
(whining):
All-all three of these
proposals have merit.
How do I choose?
Well, not with that voice.
There has got to be
a right decision
based on empirical evidence.
Look, I made pros
and cons lists,
three different scoring systems
and then I came up with
the best project.
to determine
what scoring system to use.
I just don't know
a meta-scoring system
So I'm working on
to score the scoring systems,
really complicated.

to walk you through it?
You want me
Cheers.
Cheers.

Are you trying to get us caught?
Turn that off.
Oh.
to three worthwhile projects,
So, I've narrowed it down
but I only have the money
to fund one of them.
I have a solution.
Lucky for you,
I can't wait.
and I fund all of them.
You free up more money
Mm, no.
Or-- hear me out--
yes.
That way, e-everybody's happy.
You can't make everybody happy.
I think I can.
You can't.
You're making me unhappy.
Well, actually...
Okay, what would you do?
and put him in charge
I'd find some sap
so I wouldn't have
to be the bad guy.
That's a really good id-- Oh.
(gasps)
Whatcha doin'?
You scared me.
(chuckles)
I'll ask again.
What-cha doin'?
Nothing.
Really?
aren't doing stuff without me?
You and Bernadette
Why would you even say that?
What? No!
You know how your talent
is getting just drunk enough
to have a good time
without being hungover
the next day?
Thank you.
(chuckles)
Well, mine is knowing
when I'm being excluded.
So spill.
I'm-I'm just running
some errands.
Yeah?
With a bag full of wine?
I...
Got to stay hydrated.
Try again.
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
to leave you out.
We did not mean

All right? Bernadette has
so we ended up hanging out
in Halley's playhouse.
Like a secret club?
place to spend time
No! Just, like, a
that we don't tell
anyone else about.
And what would be
a shorter way of saying that?
Secret club.

Well, you really hurt
my feelings.

What can I do to

Is there some sort
'Cause I would literally do
anything.
Leonard, you've

You know
what would be neat?
If this was some sort
of long con

that you actually know

A very long con indeed.

Sorry. I'm distracted.
Ooh, aren't you the hustler.

No matter

with me.
Do you really care
if people are angry at you?
Interesting.
Of course.
and get me some tapioca pudding
Why don't you go to the store
or I'm gonna be angry at you.
No.
So it comes and goes?
How do you not care what
people think of you?
It's easy.
I mean, not ""beating you
at chess"" easy,
but what is?
Wait,
you can make this decision.
You don't care if
you upset people.
You can pick for me.
I certainly could.
But I won't.
Oh, great.
a learning opportunity for you.
I think this is
Sheldon, come on.
Did I upset you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Ask me how I feel about that.
Yes.
So where does Leonard
think you are?
Oh, I told him
I was at yoga.
you are stretching the truth.
(chuckles) Well,
Sheldon think
you
are?
Yeah. Where does
kind of like a dog--
Oh, Sheldon's

when I'm gone,
but he's so happy
when I show up.

Ooh, hot.

Shh.

KOOTHRAPPALI: Thanks for
So Leonard still hasn't
made a decision yet?
No.
And I've really been
laying on the guilt.
Did you break out the sad eyes?
You mean these bad boys?
(whispering):
What do we do?
We're just gonna have to wait
till they go back inside.
Okay, okay. Can
we very quietly
open that second bottle of...
(oven dings)
don't freak out,
(quietly): Hey,
someone in your playhouse.
but I think there's
that's just Bernadette.
Oh. Yeah,
in there all week. (chuckles)
She's been hiding out
Really? Why?
(exhales)
I don't know.
a little overwhelmed at work.
She's been
me and the kids are a lot.
And, frankly,
She just... (chuckles)
needs some downtime.
And you just pretend
like you don't know?
Sure. That's
how marriage works.
Three years ago...
(chuckles)
I told her I got life insurance,
and I totally didn't.
(laughs)
Someday, she's gonna find out.
I'm gonna say,
""Ha-ha! I know you've been
hiding in the playhouse.""
Why don't you just get
the life insurance?
Whose side are you on?
what they're saying?
Can you hear
Shh, I'm trying.
(cork pops)
Huh.
Sounds like Penny's
in there, too.
you didn't pick my project?
Seriously, Leonard,
I'm sorry, Raj.
Did you go
with Crow Lady?
No.
You gave the money to Kripke?
I did not.
Wait, I'm confused.
three projects in contention.
I thought there were only
There were.
But, at the last minute,
someone submitted an application
for a pretty cool
europium-doped laser,
and they made
a very compelling case.
What was the case?
Oh, that it was me
and I wanted it.
You-you can't do that.
You can't just fund
your own project.
Uh, it turns out I can,
and I did.
Interesting.
everybody to be mad at you?
What about not wanting
Well, I realized that,
no matter what decision I made,
people were gonna be mad at me.
And this way, I get a laser.
That is the most selfish thing
you've ever done.
I'm proud of you.
And I don't care.
Yes, you do.
Yeah, I do.
The europium laser
is so cool.
It has a four-level
f-f transition
which provides for
high power output,
and its quantum efficiency
is off the charts.
What are you going
to use it for?
I have no idea.
Leonard,
there's a crow
on your roof.
I see it.
Is that one
of Dr. Lee's crows?
It has a tag on its leg.

s11ep19.xml,"-Why are you wearing a Band-Aid?
-Halley bit me.
Ha-ha. You got beaten up by a girl.
Hey, that's sexist.
You're right.
Ha-ha. You got beaten up by a baby.
-Hi.
-Hey.
What you got there?
I grabbed a sandwich
at the food truck out front.
Now, hold on. Tonight is Friday.
And I believe you know what that means.
That my fun, young life
took a drastic turn somewhere?
-No. Uh--
-But, yeah.
No, that means it's Chinese food night.
Yeah, you have Chinese food. So eat it.
But I can smell your pastrami.
And we can all hear your complaining,
so no one's happy.
-That does smell good.
-It is. I had one the other day.
What is happening?
Everybody's supposed
to be eating Chinese food.
Actually, I believe the Chinese
may have invented the sandwich.
Their dish
rou jia mo
literally means
""meat between bread.""
Looks like all of us, including Penny,
are eating Chinese food.
Except for you, Sheldon.
You're eating crow.
I'm sorry. I think you're forgetting that
the sandwich was invented by John Montagu...
...the earl of Sandwich.
Oh, the truck's called Pearl of Sandwich.
Now I get it.
All right. Ahem. That smells too good.
I gotta get one.
I think you're forgetting
there are written documents...
...of ""meat between bread""
being eaten in China during the Tang dynasty.
You know, I'll go with you.
Then maybe we just go home.
I think you're defining ""bread"" very loosely.
If we go down that road, where does it end?
Well, I would say ""when we go to bed,""
but you talk in your sleep.
I don't want to get into this with you right now.
We'll talk about this when I'm asleep.
I don't wanna talk when you're asleep.
How come we can't talk now?
I'm eating now.
Fine. How's your moo shu?
You know what, it's great.
Oh. Look at that.
Huh. Maybe the Chinese
did invent the sandwich.
I guess you were right.
Too bad no one's around to hear it.
I can smell that food truck from up here.
Just close the window
if you don't like the smell.
Of course I like the smell.
It's salt and fat.
My brain may be evolved...
...but my tongue still wants to pick up a club
and drag that truck back to my cave.
So there's something you like,
but it's also driving you crazy.
Been there, doing it now.
No, it's a distraction.
How can I focus on my work when all I can
think about is how much I want that sandwich?
So go get one.
I can't just give into every urge I have.
That's why I have a rigid schedule.
It's bad enough I had to give
into my urge to create a rigid schedule.
You know, why don't I just go down
to the food truck and ask them to move?
-Why are you taking cash?
-No reason.
Ahh, this is the life.
What could be better than this?
If you weren't wearing one of my swimsuits.
I'll give it back.
You know the rule.
Once it touches heiny, it's no longer mine-y.
Such a prude. Do you know
the things this water's touching?
Well, I'm relaxed enough.
Hey, Howard, look.
What's that?
Oh. Looks like someone's drone.
Oh, no. Think they were
spying on us in the hot tub?
I'm only 40 percent of the way
to my beach-bod.
One of the propellers is broken.
It must have crashed.
Oh. You think you can fix it?
Maybe. Should we try
and track down the owner first?
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[IN QUIET VOICE]
Anyone lose a drone?
-[IN NORMAL VOICE] Looks like it's ours.
-Yay, we got a drone!
-Shh.
-[IN QUIET VOICE] Yay, we got a drone.

The pastrami truck moved.
That is the danger
of a restaurant on wheels.
Someone complained
to the tenants association.
They're not allowed on our street.
Who would complain about
something that everyone loves--? Oh.
Did you complain to the tenants association
about the truck?
-Yes.
-What--?
They actually took you seriously?
The tenants association
takes every complaint seriously.
Great, because I'm about to send them
an e-mail complaining about you.
[PHONE CHIMES]
Excuse me.
Wow.
Someone should have spell-checked.
-What is going on?
-You're the tenants association?
You should see the look on your face.
But you might wanna tell your wife
that there's no Y in ""pastrami.""
Okay. That ought to do it.
I've replaced the propeller
and reattached the gimbal controller unit.
Dude, you're like
Grey's Anatomy
for robots.
Also, why isn't that a show?
I just need to see if I can
re-sync the controls to this old remote.
We should name it.
What? The drone
or your stupid robot show?
The drone. The show's already got a name:
General Bot-spital.
I got it working. Ha-ha.
Ooh, ooh. Let's play William Tell.
I'll put this bowl on my head.
See if you can knock it off
without hitting me.
You read my mind.
What are you doing?
Either breaking a bowl
or breaking Raj's head.
Be careful.
They don't make that bowl anymore.
That's a nice one.
Yeah, we found it in the yard
and fixed it up.
Aren't you worried
some kid's missing his drone?
Please, Bernadette.
This is not a children's toy, okay?
This thing's got a HD camera on it.
Then aren't you worried a rich Peeping Tom
is out there missing his drone?
We asked around and no one claimed it.
I think we've done all we can do.
Did you check the video card?
Maybe you could see where it started off from.
What a great idea, honey.
Let me get this straight.
You're the tenants association's president?
President, only member, and harshest critic.
I once gave myself an official reprimand
for conducting a meeting in the shower.
The steam warped my gavel.
When I got a fine for leaving my clothes
in the dryer too long, that was you?
Fourteen-ninety-nine.
The exact price of a new gavel.
The noise complaint we got
for singing you ""Happy Birthday""?
As a friend, I was touched.
As a representative of the building...
...I thought you should pick a key
and stick with it.
-Hi.
-Do you know he is the tenants association?
No, but I'm not surprised.
He is also the pope of a planet
he invented in hyperspace.
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to make sure you loved the man,
not the office.
You can't just declare yourself president.
I didn't. I called a meeting.
I was the only one to attend.
I nominated myself...
...and after a pretty moving speech
I voted myself in.
-If you can vote, then we can vote you out.
-Yeah.
-Fine. Make a motion at the next meeting.
-When?
The first Saturday of every month
unless there's an emergency meeting.
-We call an emergency meeting.
-You don't have to.
This is the first Saturday of the month.
-Okay, fine. Then we vote you out.
-Hold on. Hold on.
First, we have to read the minutes
from last month's meeting.
Amy, would you do the honors?
Why not?
""Saturday, March 3rd, 7:05,
meeting called to order.
7:06, president gets shampoo in eye.
7:07, meeting adjourned.""
-Okay, can we vote you out now?
-Ah.
Very well.
New business.
-I move for no confidence in the president.
-Yeah.
Two to one. You lose.
Not so fast. I believe we have one tenant here
who has not made her voice heard.
Oh.
We're waiting, fiancée.
Yeah, we're waiting, best friend.
Yeah, we're waiting...
...neighbor who needed a battery and
totally got one from me, no strings attached.
I don't wanna be in the middle of this.
No matter which way I vote,
I'm either a bad friend, a bad fiancée...
...or an ungrateful recipient of a battery.
Next time I have a meeting in the shower,
you can attend.
Sheldon. Sheldon for president.
I pick Sheldon.
Ugh. I can't believe my best friend
sided with Sheldon.
I can't believe my best friend is Sheldon.
I should've taken that gavel
and shoved it down his throat.
I would've gone the other way,
but it would've gotten to his throat.
-What?
-Don't be mad at me.
-I can't vote against him.
-Even when he's being crazy?
What other times are there?
-So you'll just let him get away with anything?
-Not anything.
But honestly, pastrami sandwich
is not the hill I want to die on.
It is not about the sandwich.
It's about the principle.
Yeah, principle.
-And a little bit sandwich.
-Yeah.
There are a bunch of other tenants.
All you need is for one to vote your way.
Then Sheldon's out, and I didn't betray him.
That's actually a good plan.
That you came up with all by yourself.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
...I told Sheldon I was
going to the market...
...so I'm taking some of your stuff.
I was never here.
Sometimes you don't see it because
she's next to Sheldon, but she's pretty weird.
Okay, all hooked up. Here we go.
I hope there's nothing disturbing on there.
Like you two in the hot tub?
Hold on. Now I'm getting a picture.
That's not very much to go on.
Oh, that's plenty to go on.
We can't give up. We gotta find her.
You just wanna find her because she's cute.
Not just that.
She also owns a pretty expensive drone.
So she has money and doesn't mind wasting it.
And I-- I like that in a woman.
Do you see anything
that could help us locate her?
-Let me have a look.
-She's got eagle eyes.
Always spotting
continuity errors in movies.
Heh. It's not annoying at all.
Oh, there. Right there.
The pin on her jacket.
Isn't that from the comic-book store?
Is it? Hey, Howard, zoom in.
Fine, zooming in. Pzzhoo.
Yeah, I know you're being a jerk,
but it's actually helpful.
-Hey.
-Hi, we're your neighbors from downstairs.
We've met.
Remember? I invited you
to my housewarming when I moved in.
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
It's been a crazy couple of months.
That was two years ago.
-Welcome to the building.
-Mm-hm.
I'm running for president
of the tenants association...
...and I could use your vote.
You said you were gonna stop by.
I bought a lot of food.
Meeting's tomorrow.
We really hope you can make it.
-I'll be there.
-Oh, really?
Yeah. You should buy a lot of food.
I'm running for president
of the tenants association...
...and I could use your vote.
-Who's president now?
-Sheldon Cooper.
You know, about yay-tall
and about yay-annoying.
You want me
to vote against Sheldon Cooper.
Show up at a meeting--
No, no. No can do.
He's got a restraining order against me.
-Really? Why?
-I locked him on the roof once. Heh.
[WHISPERS]
Three times.
Mrs. Petrescu, we were hoping you would
vote for Leonard instead of for Sheldon.
Vote Sheldon.
No, no, vote Leonard.
No vote Leonard.
No.
Vote Leonard.
Thank you.
She's wearing a pin from your store.
-Do you know who she is?
-Yeah. Cynthia.
-Well, so she's a customer?
-Yeah.
Yeah, but I haven't seen her in a while.
Before you say anything...
...there's a lot of reasons
women stop coming here. It's not just me.
-But this time?
-It was me. Yeah.
I was trying out a flirty new smile.
Now, I don't use the word ""ghoulish"" a lot...
...but I just can't think of another word.
-Do you know how to find her?
-Yeah.
I think I have her address
on my mailing list.
Please let me
bring the drone back to her.
You think you've got a shot?
What if she's married?
-She's not.
-It's meant to be.
Little tip: stick with the smiles you know.
Hi. What are you doing?
Leonard and Penny
are trying to turn tenants against me.
They are about to see what kind of power
the president of the tenants association wields.
""You must be at least this tall
to use washing machine.""
I'm gonna hang it up higher than Leonard.
Then his clothes will smell.
Nobody's voting for a man with smelly clothes.
Not when there's a perfectly
unscented incumbent on the ballot.
I have an advanced degree
in the study of the human brain.
If my fiancé's a raving lunatic,
it's kind of a ding on my reputation.
If leaders stepped aside every time
they didn't have consent of the governed...
...what would we have?
Democracy.
Not on my watch.
Okay. Don't be weird.
Don't be weird. Don't be weird.
[IN DEEP VOICE]
Hello. Ahem.
Hey, you found my drone.
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Yes. It took a while to track you down...
...but to see the look on your face
was worth it.
Oh, that's sweet. Heh.
Rajesh.
-Cynthia.
-Pleasure to meet you.
Likewise.
I feel like I should give you
a reward or something.
-You don't have to do that.
-I insist.
How about your phone number?
Give me your phone.
Thanks.
So I'll call you, Cynthia.
-Great, Rajesh. Heh.
-Heh-heh.
And thanks again.
Sure.
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
RAJESH:
Just checking.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hey, Sheldon.
We found something pretty interesting.
Huh. Well, that is surprising.
I, for one, have no idea
what they're talking about.
Turns out...
...when Amy took over Penny's apartment,
she was put on the lease, not you.
When I moved across the hall,
you got taken off the lease and I got added.
What are you saying?
Sheldon's not technically a tenant at all...
...and thus has no standing to be president
of the association, no matter who votes?
I don't know how you found that out,
but I am guessing ""all on your own.""
We need to figure out
who the new president should be.
-I nominate myself.
-I second it.
Huh. Well, as a woman in love,
I want to stand by my man.
Too bad that's been rendered
bureaucratically impossible.
Well, this is hard for me.
Because I do love a legal technicality,
and this is a good one.
Though, not quite as good
as the provision in California law...
...which states, ""a person who occupies
a dwelling for 30 consecutive days...
...becomes a tenant at will.""
-As such--
-I vote for Leonard.
What?
I'm sorry, Sheldon.
With minimal power
comes minimal responsibility.
And you couldn't handle it.
Don't you misquote
Spider-Man
to me.
It's not your fault.
What man wouldn't be seduced by the power
to decide how late the laundry room is open?
You're the reason I had to come back
and get my jeans the next morning?
I can't believe you expect me
to give that up.
Sheldon, it's the American way,
the peaceful transfer of power.
I don't know.
Think about
Ant-Man.
I'm always thinking about
Ant-Man.
Michael Douglas had the suit,
then he passed it on to Paul Rudd.
Maybe you're right.
Really? The
Ant-Man
thing?
That's what won you over?
Yes. He got the details right.
That's how you use a superhero.
I suppose it is time
I pass this on to Leonard.
-Thank you.
-Yeah, thanks. I know that's hard for you.
It was. But, you know what...
...instead of being in charge...
...I can now be the vocal opposition...
...criticizing and badgering
the president at every turn.
I think you'll be really good at that.
Me too.
I think I've made a huge mistake.
Me too.
-I can't believe you got her number.
-I know, right?
How amazing would it be
if this worked out...
...and the story of how I met my wife started
with you and me in the hot tub together.
Heh. Do us both a favor
and start the story later.
Whatever. I have a good feeling about this girl.
We really hit it off.
Stop flying it around. You're gonna break it.
Why do you care?
We have to give it back
to the beautiful mystery girl.
-Aww.
-Did you see how hot she was?
I want to get all up on that
and start making babies.
I know exactly what underwear
I'm gonna wear on our first date.
None."
s11ep21.xml,"HOWARD:
What you doing?
Pigeon check for Sheldon.
North side's all clear.
Great, let's look at some planets.
Why'd you lug your telescope here?
Leonard has one in our apartment.
Yeah, I'm gonna use Leonard's. Might as well
hold my hand up like this and squint.
It seemed good.
Once when the cable went out...
...I watched an entire episode
of
The Bachelor
on a TV across the street.
-This one's more of a professional model.
-So was the girl he picked.
This baby's got a 10-inch diameter
with f/10 ACF optics.
And tonight Mercury
is at its highest elongation.
It makes far away things
seem close and Mercury is a planet.
I know Mercury is a planet.
But the other thing was helpful.
Oh, look at that.
-Neil Gaiman tweeted about my store.
-What'd he say?
""Next time you're in Pasadena,
check out The Comic Center.
Great vibe, old school,
the owner really knows his stuff.""
Isn't that amazing?
It's no
Sandman
but I guess we can't expect
everything he writes to be a masterpiece.
When was he in your store?
I have no idea.
I think I would remember that.
Obviously vibranium
is the most powerful metal in comics.
More powerful than adamantium?
He's right, Wolverine's claws,
Ultron's outer shell. Need I go on?
You don't need to, but you probably will.
What about Wonder Woman's bracelets?
Good point. Strong as a metal
and fierce as a fashion choice.
You know, Thor's hammer's pretty powerful.
In the comics it's made out of enchanted uru.
Yeah, I think it's the enchantment that's
powerful, not the uru, but thanks for playing.
Oh, man, I can't believe Neil Gaiman
came in and we weren't even there.
Can you see Mercury? Can you see it?
One second.
You know,
the Greek version of Mercury, Hermes...
...was worshiped in Athens
by the carving of giant wooden phalluses.
Please, Amy, get your mind
out of the ancient Athenian gutter.
Got another follower, I'm blowing up.
-How many does that make?
-High double-digits.
-The nineties?
-Mid double-digits.
-Penny, you wanna check this out?
-Sure.
Look through here and if you
wanna take a picture, push that button.
Okay.
Oh, what is that?
Is it Mercury?
I'm really jonesing for Mercury.
I think it's early
for Mercury to be visible.
Playing hard to get. I like that in a planet.
No, there's something fuzzy.
Is it your teen years?
No.
Yes. Shut up. Look.
-I think I see something.
-It could be your eyelash.
It's not an eyelash.
-Okay, well, take a picture. Let's see.
-Okay.
Here.
-Hmm. I do see something.
-Told you.
-What is it?
-I don't know.
Maybe it's a comet.
That would be so cool.
You guys wanna see a real star,
look over here.
-What?
-I just got retweeted by Patton Oswalt's brother.
So this is really where Neil Gaiman shops?
Neil Gaiman, Nicolas Cage,
Natalie Portman. The list goes on.
They all come here?
Unless I'm lying.
Who are all these people?
Wait, is this a flash mob?
Are they dancing?
I don't know what today's dancing looks like.
Hey, guys. That tweet actually
got people to come in. Isn't that great?
No, I liked the way the store was before.
You mean, empty and sad?
Yes, it was perfect.
Like a funeral home
that sells Pokémon cards.
What am I supposed to do
if I wanna hang out and read a comic book?
Go sit on the couch.
Next to a stranger?
If I'm gonna sit, read, and ignore a woman,
it's gonna be my fiancée.
Why are you being such a baby
about the crowds? You go to Comic-Con.
I'm sorry, you're comparing
this place to Comic-Con?
Well, can I go to the bathroom here next to
a Wookiee who got his zipper stuck in his fur?
Wow, we go to Comic-Con
for different reasons.
You know, just-- Get me a copy of
Action Comics 1000
and I'll be on my way.
Sorry, all out.
Now you just let people
come in and buy them?
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
your soul was also for sale.
Well, it wasn't. But make me an offer.
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
-Who's that?
-Sheldon.
-Who's he mad at?
-Neil Gaiman.
-Who's that?
-Not us.
Great.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-So guess what.
That indeed was a comet last night,
and it turns out no one's seen it before.
-[LAUGHS] Wow.
-Really? Look at that.
I discovered a comet.
-What do you mean you discovered it?
-Well, I'm the one who saw it.
In my telescope that I positioned.
All you did was look into it.
You both discovered it. You can put
both your names on the registration form.
-Actually, we can't.
-Why not?
When I filled it out, it asked for name of
discoverer. I put Rajesh Koothrappali because....
Because that's who I am
and that's what I did.
-Are you kidding me?
-He is the one who knew it was a comet.
No, he didn't. He thought it was an eyelash.
And you thought it was a fuzzy streak.
Do you even know what a comet is?
Yeah, the thing I saw first.
I honestly don't think
that that qualifies as a discovery.
-I took the picture.
-Because I told you to.
If a monkey took the picture,
did it discover the comet?
Excuse me?
-He didn't mean monkey.
-Get out of my apartment.
She didn't mean that--
I think she did, you should go.
You look great.
Thanks. Would you believe this
is a dress from before I was pregnant?
Well, it's not a competition,
but I wore this suit to my bar mitzvah.
Where's Stuart?
I told him we had a 6:30 reservation.
I'll call him.
[RINGTONE PLAYING]
Comic Center,
where the real superhero's you.
Stuart, you're supposed to be babysitting.
Oh, shoot, that was tonight. I forgot.
The store's been really busy.
-Well, when can you get here?
-I don't think I can.
Listen to this, I was ringing
up a customer and someone said:
""Hey, there's a line,""
and I looked, and there was.
-Oh, come on, you can't do this to us.
-I am really sorry, I will make it up to you.
But it won't be a Val Kilmer Batman figurine
because some sucker's buying that right now.
Heh-heh. Not you, this is great.
He says he has to work.
It's okay, we can have
date night another night.
But you got all dressed up. We were
supposed to have dinner and romance.
We'll just have to divide and conquer.
I'll go to dinner, and you can stay home
with the Internet and have romance.
Okay, look, I Googled it.
I took the picture, so it's my discovery.
He stole my comet.
I know, but do you really care?
Yes, I care. This happens to me all the time.
People assume I don't know
what I'm talking about.
I'm sure that's not true.
I'm sorry, are you saying
I don't know what I'm talking about?
No, I'm not saying anything. Ever again.
I'm serious. The other day at work,
I had this great idea.
No one was listening to me.
Paul said the same thing.
-They carried him around the room.
-What was it?
CPK for lunch, but that's just one example.
It also happens with all the doctors
I deal with. They're so condescending.
I'm sick of stuff sliding. I found that
comet. Why should I let Raj say he found it?
I know you're right,
but this could be good for his career.
Okay, so you agree with me,
but he still gets his way.
There you go, everybody wins.
You're such a people-pleaser.
You can't stand making anyone angry.
-Why would I want to make anyone angry?
-It would mean you were on my side.
Oh, I am on your side. Hey--
Let's not forget
who you're really mad at here. Raj.
Oh, and Paul-- Paul sucks, right?
But don't tell him I said that.
Hey, Howard.
Did you see that--?
[GASPS]
I'm over here, Sheldon.
That was a close one.
I almost went home with that guy.
You doing okay? Do we need to go?
No, I'm fine. I admit, all these people
did take me by surprise at first...
...but I've learned that I can accept change.
Since when?
I managed it when Amy switched
her shampoo from Prell to Prell for oily hair.
Although, I do miss the way her head
used to slide off the pillow.
May I help you?
-Who are you?
-Oh, I'm Denise, the new assistant manager.
Nope.
Can you believe it?
In the past decade I've spent
thousands of dollars in that store.
And this is the thanks I get.
You're right. I mean,
he could at least get you a mug.
He gave me a mug.
What do you think I'm drinking out of?
Do you even pay attention?
Honestly, less and less.
Amy, the comic book store is like my version
of the country in
Black Panther.
Okay, I'm afraid this is gonna get
really offensive to certain groups...
...but go on.
The nation of Wakanda was a hidden gem...
...and they wanted to keep it that way because
they knew if they opened it up to the world...
...everything that was special about it
would get ruined.
-Are you done?
-Yes.
Oh. Okay.
That both made sense and wasn't offensive.
And to make things worse,
Stuart hired some woman.
There we go.
I'm not annoyed that she's a woman.
I'm annoyed, and she's a woman.
No, I get that.
I'm annoyed, and I'm a woman.
It's just Stuart knows my likes and dislikes,
and I can count on his discretion...
...if I pick up the occasional back issue
of
Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen.
Which I don't.
Well, don't think of her as a stranger.
Just think of her as...
...a friend you haven't berated,
lectured or condescended to yet.
I hadn't thought of it that way.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
You know, you're wise.
And you smell like books.
You really are the whole package.
Raj, just help me out.
Penny's pretty mad about this comet thing.
Well, I'm sorry she's upset
but she didn't discover it.
You know she was part of it.
Just add her name to the registration.
But I told everyone at work I did it.
My boss was so excited
he started calling me Captain Comet.
Which is better
than his last nickname for me, Dr. Donuts.
Because one time I had two donuts.
And two times I had three donuts.
I guess you're just gonna
have to swallow your pride.
I-- I can't do that.
Sure you can.
Just pretend it's two or three donuts.
You don't understand, Leonard,
I need this.
My last big discovery
was if you press your upper lip hard enough...
...you can block a sneeze.
I told you that.
This is all my fault.
I brought this upon myself. Tsk.
I'm a bad scientist.
-I'm a selfish person.
-No, no, don't get upset.
You're not a bad person, just let me...
...talk to Penny.
I'm sure I can make her understand.
Thank you. You're a good friend, Leonard.
I'm glad you think so,
because I may be living here soon.
Just look at her over there.
She just started
and she gets to put up Staff Picks.
I've been coming here over 10 years,
and I still can't put up Sheldon Dislikes.
I talked to her yesterday.
She really seems to know her stuff.
Challenge accepted.
That is not what that was.
Excuse me, I was wondering
if you could recommend something.
-Oh, sure. You wanna tell me what you like?
-I would not.
Well, you're wearing a Green Lantern shirt,
so I'm guessing you're a DC fan.
That's from the Alan Scott era,
you're probably not into the current run.
How would you feel
about an alternate history...
...where World War I was fought
with dragons and magic?
That's what I wanted the theme
of my 10th birthday party to be.
Here. Check this out. It's by Kurt Busiek.
If you're interested in alternate histories,
Neil Gaiman wrote one called
1602
.
I'm sorry, we're in the middle of something.
It is good.
He takes the Marvel superheroes...
...and he puts them
into Elizabethan England.
Let me guess, everyone thinks
the X-Men are witches?
Yeah.
Take this home, if you don't like it...
...return it, and I'll give your money back.
Don't tell Stuart.
Stuart who?
Hey, where have you been?
I went to yell at Raj.
And? Is he gonna
give me back my comet?
Interesting thing.
Did you cave?
Maybe I did, or, maybe I did.
But I did realize something.
I don't need to fight your battles.
You-- You are a strong
and independent woman.
You have your own voice.
And to quote another strong woman...
...Katy Perry, it's time to hear you roar.
You think of that on your way home?
What do you want?
The song was on in the car.
But, it doesn't mean it's not true.
No, you make a good point.
I'm gonna go talk to Raj myself.
I know I don't say it enough,
but you go girl. Heh-heh.
That was enough.
-What's all this?
-Well...
...we missed our date night,
and Stuart's working again, so...
-...I thought we could have date night at home.
-That's so sweet.
Oh. So...
...is that really what you're wearing
to our date night?
Well, Stuart's not here
and the kids are sleeping.
I could wear nothing.
You might wanna hold off on that,
we're starting with soup.
-Hey.
-I thought you were working late again.
-Oh, I was, but Denise has got it covered.
-Oh.
The funniest thing happened today,
you know the...
...receipt tape in the cash register?
It ran out. I didn't even know it could do that.
-We were sitting down to dinner.
-Oh. Perfect timing. I'll wash up.
There goes date night.
You kidding? Stuart's here,
get your purse, we're going out.
-What about the dinner you made?
-Right. We--
Hey, Stuart, that can of soup
by the stove, that's for you.
-You made canned soup for date night?
-You wore sweatpants, let's go.
Oh, and it turns out Denise is also excited
for Dan Slott's run on Iron Man...
...because he was her favorite
Spider-Man writer too.
How about that.
Oh, and guess who goes to art school
right here in Pasadena?
Hmm. I don't know. Denise?
You're a good guesser, Amy.
Not as good as Denise though.
She thought I would like this comic,
Arrowsmith
, and she was right.
Was the store crowded?
I bet it was, I know you hate that.
It was, but if it weren't for the crowds...
...Stuart never would've hired Denise,
and she's the best.
-You must be Denise.
-Yeah, how can I help you?
I'm Amy, Sheldon's fiancée.
Oh. Heh. I gotta be honest,
I wasn't 100 percent sure you were real.
Oh, I am. And I heard you and Sheldon
had a great time talking about comic books.
-We did.
-Great, here's what's gonna happen.
-You're gonna teach me how to do that.
-Do what?
Pretend to like comic books.
Oh, no, I actually like comic books.
Let's not get hung up on semantics.
It's late, we got a lot of work to do.
[RUNNING FOOTSTEPS]
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
I'm sorry.
I haven't said anything.
I know, I heard your footsteps
coming up the stairs and they sounded angry.
Well, they are angry. I'm mad at you.
And you have every right to be.
Okay? I was being a jerk
We did this together,
and I hogged all of the credit.
And after you've been
such a good friend to me.
I wouldn't be able to talk to women
if it wasn't for you...
...so I'm gonna make sure
that your name is on the comet.
Thank you.
Even if it's professionally embarrassing.
You know,
or maybe put me on thin ice at work.
I may lose my funding.
Still....
-Still want to make this right.
-Good. Bye.
[RUNNING FOOTSTEPS]
That worked way better with Leonard.
[DOOR OPENS]
-Hello.
-Hi.
Why are you reading a comic book?
Denise recommended it to me.
It's the
Rebirth Omnibus
.
She thought it would be a...
...good entry point for me
into the DC universe.
-I have to say, I really do like--
-Amy, I've talked a lot about comic books lately.
Can we talk about something else?"

Cool.
Yeah.

No, with them in his room,

How would you like to be
my best man?
Wait, you're not seriously

marrying a woman
you've met once.
Why not? She's nice, I'm nice.
We're just as likely to be happy
as any other two people.
Maybe even happier.
Sorry, that was not
a swipe at you.
I didn't think it was.
Yeah, good, 'cause it was not.

What are you talking about?
You married a woman
you're in love with.
I can't believe you're throwing
that back in my face.
Why can't you just be
happy for me?
Because you're being dumb.
You don't know anything
about her.
W-Well, how come you all
get to be married
and I have to stay single?
for a licensed professional.
I think that's a question
You know what, you're not
just insulting me.
Okay? You're insulting
my family, my culture
and my future bride, Anu,
a master's degree from Cornell

whose favorite fruit
is pineapple.
Now, I'm not sure if this helps,
but did you know
were once so rare
that pineapples
that King Charles posed

How does that help?
I've been trying to slide that
Oh, it helped me.
into a conversation for years.
(door closes)
Hey, honey,
how was your day?
(groans)
What's wrong?
Raj is talking about
marrying this woman
he just met.
I told him it was dumb,
and now he's mad at me.
The same thing
happened to me.
Penny said she
didn't want kids,
and I told her
she was being silly,
and she accused me
of being condescending.
Which is crazy, because
if I wanted to be condescending,
I would've said,
""Ooh, 'condescending.'
That's such a big word.""
Why won't our friends
just listen to us?
We obviously know what
we're talking about.
I know.
We're married,
we have great kids,
great jobs,

Hey, Leonard,

Yeah?
Well, what if it wasn't someday.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, are you pregnant?
No. No. No, no. No, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.
So?
Oh.
No.
What I meant was,
what if, what if we
didn't have kids?

No, you can't;
it'll hurt their feelings.
I'm okay with that.

I'd always wear
a new pair of underwear,
just in case.

because these are no longer
tighty nor whitey.
Okay, I'm out.

Oh, good. You

than things that aren't it,

Well, yeah, that's great.

just have to have that.""

to the actual present?
that will lead us
If you're asking
if you and Amy should spend
the next couple days
running all over town searching
for the next clue,
I'm gonna have to say yes.
I knew it!
This is so much fun.
Oh, it really is.

Aw.

No, not even close.

What did you give them?
Well, what is it?
Oh, i-it's just this

what we did.

That's exciting.

myself last night.
I was trying
to find the remote.
one of the cushions.
I looked under
Wasn't there.
Then I lifted the cushion
a little higher.
Bingo.
Riveting.
So, do you know what it is?
Of course I know what it is.
It's a silicon dioxide crystal,
otherwise known as quartz.
Are you sure?
extrusive igneous rock formed
Am I sure? Is basalt a mafic
of magnesium and iron-rich lava?
by the rapid cooling
Yeah, I'm sure.
Okay, so it's quartz.
That's got
to mean something.
What do we know
about quartz?
I'll google it.
Or you can ask me, the geologist
who won the MacArthur
Genius Grant.
Got it!
Quartz, from the
German ""quarz""
which sounds the same, but
is spelled without a ""T"".
Interesting. No ""T"".
What is not ""T""?
Coffee!
The coffee shop
where we first met!
All right, let's go.
Sorry.
I think I just had an adrenaline
rush from having visitors.
Hey, Raj, will you, um,
smell something for me?
Uh, that depends.
Actually, it doesn't depend.
Just no.
I'm trying out some new colognes
for my date with Denise.
Oh, and you just came over here
that you have a date?

Okay, this is where
we first met.
There's got to be a clue
here somewhere.
(gasps) We sat at that table.
Excuse me.
We're on a scavenger hunt.

Maybe they left it

in eight years,
you could marry this woman.
That's my sister.
Well, don't tell people.
That's not okay.
Sheldon, look,
I asked the barista
if anyone
left anything for us,
and she said to look
in this lost and found box.
the lost and found box?
But why would it be in
Because we were lost,
and then we found each other.
It makes perfect sense.
Oh. And look at this.
A locket.
And that stone in front--
I bet it's quartz.

This must be it. This
What's inside?
Open it up.
Nothing. It's empty.
Of course.

to show you something,
but you have to promise
not to make fun of me.
Of course.
Whoa.
Yeah. I was worried
about the date
so I got my hair colored to make
me feel a little more confident,
paler, so I-I got a spray tan.
but that just made me look
Have you tried

Yes. That's why I'm calling.

of marrying an Indian woman,
this is exciting news.
My goodness, Rajesh,

You tell me.

I want you
I'm just so tired

I'm-I'm ready to settle down.
and I'm finally just...
I can't just call up

It's-it's not 2015 anymore.
I know that, but I can't do this
on my own. I need your help.

Fine, if that's what it takes

Uh, quick question.
Do you mean

Instagram,
or all my social...?
All of them!
Okay, deal.
Let me ask you a question.
All right.
What do you think of this woman?
Oh. Oh, my God, she's beautiful.
Is that who you're going
to set me up with?
No! That's who
I'm

she has an older sister.
But maybe
So we put a little picture of me
and a little picture
of Sheldon in it.
In-in the locket?
Yes.
a lost and found box?
That was in
Exactly.
Where we hid it?
So really, you gave us
three amazing gifts.
You gave the locket,
the adventure
and the realization
that Amy and I can do anything
as long as we
work together.
We wrote you a special
thank you note.
Oh.
Are those words?
No.
It's a secret code that you two
get to figure out together.
Hint: it's based
on Sanskrit,
but not the Sanskrit
you're thinking of.
(laughs)
And best of all, you can't use
the Internet to cheat.
Because we locked you
out of your Wi-Fi,
and the answer to this
is your new password.
I'm no longer happy.
Hey, guys. Great news.
I'm getting married.
Huh?
What?
No.
Well, I-I haven't met her yet,
but her name is Anu.
My father says she comes
from a good family.
She's in her 30s.
in hospitality management.
She works
So, as long as I can get
through six to ten dates
without revealing
my true self...
...this is happening.
I know just what we're giving
them for a wedding gift.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
I wanted to look my best
for our date,
and I made a series
of bad decisions...
...one of which is hidden
by my pants.
Wow. (laughs)
Do you still want
to go out with me?
Absolutely. Hey, maybe we
can go find Nemo together.
That's a good one.
(clears throat)
friends know you're out?

Are you just gonna
make fun of me all night?

Probably.

a rental car and turns into the Hulk...
...do you he's covered or does he need to add
the Hulk as an additional driver?
You really need a girlfriend.
Oh! Mailman's here.
Aww. Remember when he used to be
that excited to see us?
Do you have any mail
for Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
I do, but I can't hand it right to you,
I have to put it in the box.
That is what separates the U.S. Postal Service
from those hippies at FedEx.
Oh, goody.
What is so exciting?
It's a letter from Dr. Wolcott.
We've been corresponding
about my string theory research.
Wait, Robert Wolcott?
Like Wolcott's Theorem, Wolcott?
The very same.
RAJESH: Didn't he go crazy
and cut off all contact with people?
HOWARD: Yeah, he was driven mad
by a friend who kept wanting to talk about...
...the Hulk's car insurance.
He's invited me to his cabin for the weekend
to discuss a breakthrough he's had.
HOWARD:
His cabin?
Yes, he lives off the grid
up in the mountains.
So you're gonna go to the middle of nowhere
and spend the weekend...
...with a crazy man you've never met?
Yes, why?
No reason, have fun.
SHELDON:
Hmm.
Oh.
Hmm.
Ha. Nice one.
Hey, Penny, that's what
you sound like when you read. Heh-heh.
-Ha-ha-ha.
-Hey.
What? He said it.
-Sheldon, what are you doing?
-I'm decoding Dr. Wolcott's letter...
...using this book as the key.
Aren't conversations more fun in code?
Yes. But I'm using a code
where ""yes"" means ""no.""
Oh, I got it.
He's given me directions to his cabin.
He seems a little paranoid.
He is not paranoid. Ahem.
-What are you doing?
-Following his instructions.
Leonard, you are not letting him
go alone this weekend.
I am a grown man,
I don't need somebody to chaperone me.
I just need him to drop me off,
pick me up and pack me a sack lunch.
Don't look at me, when the music stopped,
you were holding Sheldon.
Amy can't take him,
it's her bachelorette party this weekend.
Yes it is, because I'm getting married!
-Are you gonna do that all weekend?
-Yes, know why?
-Because you're getting married!
-Whoo!
Leonard,
looks like you're driving me.
You could drop me
at the bottom of the mountain.
I want him to think I'm cool.
That's great. Everyone's got weekend plans.
Amy has her party
and Sheldon's going to the woods...
...and get hunted for sport.
As someone who has to track him
every time he gets lost in IKEA...
...I feel like I'd be really good at that.
You cannot drop him off,
you have to stay with him and keep him safe.
-Howard, you have to go keep Leonard safe.
-Fine.
I get it. And you want me
to go and keep Howard safe.
-Actually--
-Just say yes...
...or he's gonna wanna come
to the bachelorette party.
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay this weekend?
Of course.
I'm much more concerned about you.
I know how you gals behave
when the men are away.
You do?
I've read
The Bacchae
by Euripides.
Drinking wine, riding panthers.
Proof that girls have gone wild
for over 2500 years.
I wish I could say none of that
is gonna happen, but Penny is planning it.
She is the reason I own those underwear
with writing across the butt.
Well, just be careful.
And use protection.
What do you think is gonna happen?
I don't know. But it's going to be sunny
and you burn easily.
It'll be fine.
I'm sure there will be some drinking
and dancing and then a mailman...
...will probably show up
and take his clothes off.
Nicholas is going to take his clothes off?
No. Not our mailman.
A dancer pretending to be a mailman.
Impersonating a federal employee?
Where's the after party, prison?
It's sweet that you're worried about me.
Of course I'm worried about you.
I want you to be safe.
And I want you to be safe.
I will be. I'll have my friends with me.
If anything should go wrong,
I can use them as human shields.
MAN [ON STEREO]:
For most of human history,
time was believed...
...to be an objective part of reality.
But with the contributions of Immanuel Kant,
science and philosophy charted....
When I said you should make
a playlist for the road trip, I meant music.
This is better than music.
This is a lecture on non-linear time.
It sounds like it's just on regular time.
Yes, but I put it on shuffle.
This is nice.
The four of us haven't taken
a trip like this since Leonard's bachelor party.
And now here we are for Sheldon's.
Yeah, uh-- Leonard.
As Sheldon's best man, I need to inform you
that this is not a bachelor party.
-And tell them why.
-Because you're a tiresome scold.
No, it's because a bachelor party
is typically a hedonistic blowout...
...where no pleasures of the flesh are denied.
I'm not interested in that.
How is that not exactly what I said?
Okay, now, I promised Sheldon
things weren't gonna get too crazy tonight.
-Should I be worried?
-No. Just about who you're marrying. Ahem.
Just come on.
Welcome to your...
...bachelorette party.
Oh....
It's a quilting bee.
My bachelorette party's a quilting bee. Heh.
-Isn't it perfect?
-You know, instead of oiled-up strippers...
...and sex toys, we thought,
""What does Amy like?""
Amy likes a quilting bee.
Well, this place is creepy.
Why?
Did you see his vegetable garden?
Heirloom tomatoes in April. Creepy.
Okay, listen,
Dr. Wolcott is a brilliant topologist.
We need to set ground rules
so you don't embarrass me.
No magic, no whining.
Just no.
-Hey.
-How come he gets to whine?
Dr. Wolcott.
Dr. Wolcott.
Dr. Wolcott.
[LOCKS UNLOCKING]
That's a lot of locks.
It's a lot of knocks.
They're made for each other.
-Dr. Wolcott.
-Dr. Cooper.
Uh.... Who are these people?
These are my friends.
I wrote about them in my letter.
A letter? I didn't get a letter.
That's because I just sent it this morning.
Yeah. So score one for linear time.
Well, um, I don't normally allow strangers
into my house.
But when you do, you let them out, right?
Dr. Cooper, if you can promise me
these men share your intellect...
...and academic rigor, yeah...
...I suppose they can join us.
You guys might need to wait in the car.
Well, let me show you around.
This is the chair
where I do most of my thinking.
My thinking about work.
Now, my thinking about people
who have wronged me I do over there.
I always said I should get a grudge chair.
Leonard, have I not always said that?
Yes, but you were worried
you'd spend too much time in it.
Yeah.
That is a real concern.
Oh, my God. This tomato is amazing.
Like, I can eat it like an apple.
My secret is I fertilize it
with my own manure.
The look on your face. Heh-heh-heh.
It's a sort of grin.
You wanna know what kind?
So, Dr. Wolcott, in your letter you said
you had a new mathematical approach...
...that would help me conceptualize
the dimensions in string theory.
Yes, yes, yes.
But before we get started...
...I am going to need to collect
everybody's phone. Here we are.
Why?
Because they're little listening devices,
aren't they?
Yes, for people to spy on you
and steal your work.
What happened to the good old days
where if someone wanted to steal your work...
...they had to hire a prostitute
to seduce you?
Who told you about that?
Just making a joke.
Yeah, it's not funny when it happens.
All right, now,
you're probably going to want to start...
...with this notebook here.
-Here we are.
-Oh. Oh, my.
Oh.... Um....
No offense, Dr. Wolcott,
but I'm not sure this makes any sense.
That's because I've written it all backwards.
Wow.
That's ""wow"" backwards.
-Hmm. You know, I still don't get it.
-Well, plus, the numbers are letters...
-...and the letters are numbers.
-Oh.
I love him.
Are you having fun?
Yeah, I just, uh, finished sewing this
top-to-bottom.
Now I'm gonna sew it side-to-side.
-Pace yourself.
-Heh-heh.
-Some more tea?
-Oh.
Lovely.
Oh.
[GIGGLING]
Seriously? What the hell?
-What?
-This is my bachelorette party?
-Tea and quilts?
-You said you didn't want anything crazy.
Yes, but I said it like,
''I don't want anything crazy.""
Which clearly means I wanted
something crazy.
I mean, is this how boring you think I am?
Penny, she asked you a question.
Of course not.
-So you thought I'd like quilting?
-Well, don't you?
Of course I like quilting,
it's the slowest way to make a blanket.
But this is my bachelorette party.
it's supposed to be fun...
-...and wild and full of bad decisions.
-Hey, we can make bad decisions.
Yeah, she had two kids
back-to-back and I thought you'd like this...
...so we're off to a good start.
Let's go somewhere
we can do body shots off shirtless bartenders.
-Yes.
-I don’t know, that might be too much.
Why don't we stay home,
have a little wine--
What are you not getting about this?
Dr. Wolcott,
your work on time is revolutionary.
I would say thank you,
but in my theory of time...
...you've already called my work revolutionary,
I've already thanked you...
...and I hate repeating myself,
so let's move on.
Wait a minute, are you saying that time
has multiple dimensions, the same as space?
No, no. I'm not saying it,
the math is saying it.
Though it is the math I invented,
so, yes, I guess I am saying it.
Are you understanding any of this?
I haven't understood anything
since poop tomato.
My goodness, this is incredible.
See, I'm just not seeing
where string theory fits into all this...
...and that's where I think
we could help each other.
Thank you, I'd be honored.
All right, allow me to show you
my most recent journal.
Sheldon's right.
This guy-- This guy's brilliant.
Yeah. I mean, he's a little kooky,
but a mind that can re-conceptualize time...
...probably has a reason for keeping a jar
of toenail clippings that we don't understand.
I could spend months
going through his math.
You know, I think Sheldon might.
Great, who's gonna tell Amy
we lost her fiancé to a madman...
...in the mountains?
Hey, I drove.
This is so exciting.
Can we do a body shot?
I've always wanted to do a body shot.
Also, what's a body shot?
It's when you take a drink
out of a stranger's belly button.
No, thanks. What if they have an outie?
Does it just spill everywhere? Ugh.
-We've got all night. Let's just take it easy, we--
-I'm getting married.
[ALL CHEERING]
-Here you go, first round's on the house.
-Ooh.
-Hey, there. Do you do body shots?
-Oh.
-She said she didn't--
-Mind your business.
Cheers.
Amy? Amy?
Should we get her home?
Why? She's sound asleep
and we have sliders coming.
One more round.
So how would this work
in the context of a singularity?
Yes, that's a tricky bit to explain.
I assume you're familiar
with non-abelian group theory.
Oh. And how. You never forget
your first group theory.
I'm gonna put on a pot of coffee,
there's a lot of math to go through.
And he said he didn't want
a wild bachelor party.
-Excuse me?
-Oh, uh, Sheldon's getting married in a month.
Oh! Congratulations.
Yeah, I'm a married man myself.
-Oh, really? Is she here?
-And alive?
And can people other than you see her?
She lives in Munich. It's a perfect marriage.
We focus on our work
and send each other cards every year...
-...on our birthdays. Wait, what month is it?
-Uh, April.
Most years.
The point is,
we give each other space.
I give her Europe,
she gives me South America.
That's where she thinks I'm living. Heh.
I've never considered
a long-distance marriage.
Well, if you wanna be a great scientist,
you can't afford to be distracted.
Hey. Where are my manners?
You fellows must be hungry.
Do you like rabbit?
-Yeah. Sure.
-Sounds good.
Okay.
But can you tell the difference
between rabbit and squirrel?
-No.
-Probably not.
Great.
We're having rabbit.
Be right back.
It is amazing how much he's accomplished
by isolating himself...
...from the distractions of day-to-day life.
Okay, please don't tell me
you wanna live like this.
See, that's the strange thing, I don't.
What is wrong with me?
Why don't I want this?
Look how cool it all is.
Nothing is wrong with you.
You have friends.
You have a fiancée. You have a full life.
You know what?
You're right.
Thank you for bringing me up here.
But I think I'm ready to go home now.
Really? You don't wanna stay
and talk more science?
No, no. We better go.
I miss Amy.
And my phone.
[GUNSHOT]
Also, I'm from Texas and I can taste
the difference between rabbit and squirrel.
[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]
[GASPING]
Oh, look who's back.
There she is.
What happened? How did we get here?
You don't remember anything?
I remember taking some shots
and then that's it.
Oh, my gosh, did I pass out?
-You kind of did.
-At my own bachelorette party?
I'm so lame.
Well, you didn't pass out before
you did all kinds of fun stuff.
-What did I do?
-What did you do? Heh.
What did she do?
Um....
Well, you don't remember
Riverdancing on top of the bar?
I did that?
-Yeah, you did.
-Mm.
But I don't know how to Riverdance.
Didn't stop you from teaching
all those shirtless firemen.
I saw shirtless firemen?
Saw, smelled, slid down like a pole.
Did I flash anybody?
How about everybody?
I can't believe it, I'm so embarrassed.
You didn't take any pictures, did you?
No, we would never do that to you.
Yeah. But if there were pictures,
they would be crazy.
You guys are good friends.
Dinner.
Guys?
I can't believe they left
without saying goodbye.
Wait a minute, what if they stole my work?
Wait a minute.
What if they were never here at all?
Wait a minute.
What if they haven't gotten here yet,
but they're on their way?
I better tidy up.
Hello.
Welcome back. How'd it go?
Dr. Wolcott's theories of time might save
my new interpretation of string theory.
-Oh, well, that's exciting.
-Yeah.
It is.
How was your bachelorette party?
Well, I was in a bar...
...and I saw some shirtless men.
They were firemen
and they fought over me.
But Penny and Bernadette got me out of there
before the victor got my spoils.
I see.
What's the matter? You look glum.
Amy...
...would you still love me
if I wasn't who you thought I was?
What are you talking about?
Well, what if it turns out
I'm not the single-minded...
...science-obsessed recluse
who puts his work above everything...
...and everybody else
that you fell in love with?
What if I'm not the straitlaced,
buttoned-up, quilting queen...
...you thought I was?
What if I'm a Riverdancing wild woman?
I'd still love you.
I'd still love you too.
Do you really know how to Riverdance?
You tell me.
I'm the only man you do that for."

What are you doing?
The light is red, so I came to a stop.
You're in a stolen cop car
with a dead hooker in the trunk.
You don't have to obey traffic laws.
I know I don't have to.
The fun is choosing to.
Hey. Missed you guys
at the faculty mixer.
Oh, you should've been there.
Dessert was bananas.
Sorry. That was misleading.
Dessert was pie, but the pie was bananas.
Actually, the pie was cherry,
but the taste of the pie was...
...bananas.
Those mixers are such a waste
of university money.
If they spent less money on
frivolous nonsense...
...and more money on science,
we'd all be better off.
You're a theoretical physicist.
What more do you need
than an office and a whiteboard?
Someday, my new formulas
on entropy decrease...
...due to decoherence
will need to be tested.
And that will require funding.
Your theories are pretty abstract.
I wouldn't know how to design
the experiment to prove them.
Says the experimental physicist.
Oh, I know a place the university
can make cuts. Bye, Leonard.
One second. He's got a point.
In order to corroborate your research,
you'd have to create a black hole.
Wouldn't that destroy the Earth?
Well, perhaps.
But we'd all go to the grave
knowing I was right.
I guess you could create a contained
microscopic black hole.
Huh. Interesting.
Welcome back, Leonard.
Sorry, you're out.
-What did I do?
-Exactly.
Ooh. This one's pretty.
Mmm. My mother wouldn't approve.
It shows too much clavicle.
She calls it ""the bosom's welcome mat.""
I can't wait to get drunk
and pick a fight with her at your wedding.
It's so hard to tell what will look good.
This is to give you ideas.
Do you want simple and elegant?
Do you want a train?
Ooh! We're talking about trains.
Not the kind you like.
Oh, I like all kinds of trains.
Steam, diesel, coal, elevated, bullet....
I defy you to name a train I don't like.
The kind on a wedding dress?
I did not see that coming. Good job.
While we're on the subject...
...I'm asking the university for funding.
What should I wear?
I've got a push-up bra I can loan you
that always gets me free drinks.
-How much money are you asking for?
-Five hundred million dollars.
Then I'd go no bra.
What do you need
that kind of money for?
I have figured out
an experimental design...
...that may corroborate
my thinking on string theory.
I just need 2148 high-power lasers...
...to compress 20 micrograms of gold
into a volume...
...to make a microscopic black hole.
Just nod.
They're not gonna give you
half-a-billion dollars.
They won't give me that...
...and I keep promising I can make
people's brains grow younger.
-Can you?
-No. Shh.
It's the only way to settle the contradictions
between gravity and quantum mechanics.
It's too much.
You can't ask for that all at once.
What if I ask for six easy installments...
...of $83,333,333.33?
Okay. What if you asked for 20 million?
I'm trying to do science.
Not hire Lady Gaga
to come to my birthday.
Do you even know who Lady Gaga is?
Presumably the wife of Lord Gaga.
Sheldon, Penny's got a point.
When you want something big
from someone...
...you gotta be careful not to scare them.
You've got to start small
and build up slowly...
...even if it takes eight years.
Eight long years.
That's oddly specific.
-Have you ever done that?
-Nope.
So with this level of
high-power laser array...
...we would actually be able to solve
the black hole information paradox.
Impressive. How much funding
were you looking for?
Twenty million dollars.
Really? You think you can build that
for $20 million?
Not a chance.
I'm sorry. Why are you asking me for it?
Once you've spent $20 million...
...you're more likely
to give an additional 50.
What you're saying is
with $70 million, you can build this.
I can see why you think that, but no.
You can't go to the trustees...
...and say you gave me $70 million
and nothing to show for it.
No. The only way you'd be able to
save face is to double down.
So, 140?
And then double again.
Two-eighty?
And then, good news,
not quite, double again.
So, what do you say?
Do we have a deal?
-He said no?
-No, that's only a two letter word.
You're gonna have to double down.
I'm sorry, Sheldon.
But this sort of thing happens.
Higgs had to wait 50 years...
...before they built a collider
to prove his theory.
Fifty years?
I want to play with it now.
You just have to wait
for science to catch up...
...or technology to get cheaper.
Think about DVD players.
They used to cost a thousand dollars.
But just the other day,
I used one to smash a bug.
Yeah, you just have to be patient.
What if while I'm being patient,
someone more relentless than me...
...badgers their university
into giving them money?
If there's someone more relentless
than you, I'd like to meet them.
I would not.
I'm not waiting for the university.
I'll find another way to raise the money.
If it's a booth where
we can throw a pie at you...
...I'm in for 20 bucks.
Forty, if I can throw a DVD player.
Would you like some champagne?
-Thank you.
-Sure.
This is nice.
What, helping Amy find a dress
or day drinking?
It's just nice, okay?
-What do you think?
-Amy. Oh, my God.
-You look so beautiful.
-I feel beautiful.
And look, both clavicles.
Take that, Mom.
You know what they say.
If you got them, flaunt them.
Is it possible that the very first dress
is the dress?
Don't be silly.
You can't buy the first dress.
That'd be like marrying the first guy you--
You can't buy the first dress you try on.
Finger sandwiches too?
This place is amazing.
Interesting thing about finger sandwiches.
Put enough together, you got a sandwich.
AMY:
Guys, we have a problem.
-You okay?
-What's wrong?
I look amazing in all of these dresses!
Whoa, look at your waist.
Where you been hiding that thing?
Heh-heh-heh. Bernadette, stop.
Penny, you say something nice now.
When Sheldon sees you in that dress,
he's gonna wanna take it off, fold it...
...carefully place it in a storage box,
label it and then ravish you.
-Should I try on more?
-Are you having fun?
Am I having fun being beautiful?
Of course I am.
Great. Keep going.
AMY:
This is it. This is the one.
Do you love it?
Do you?
I do.
Wow.
Also... wow. Heh-heh.
-Hello, Leonard.
-Hi.
Are you doing anything?
No, I'm just sitting here at my desk
typing on my computer for nothing.
That was my guess,
but didn't want to assume.
Can you help me shoot
my Kickstarter video?
You think people are gonna give you
half-a-billion dollars?
Of course not. But if I can raise enough
to show that I'm serious...
...I should be able to attract
some major investors.
And look at the cool incentives I'm offering.
For $50,000,
I will examine your diet...
...and create a customized
bathroom schedule.
That's fitting. Fifty grand down the toilet.
How about this, for $100,000...
...I will design the flag
of your house or apartment.
For one million dollars...
...I will come over and tell you
what's wrong with you.
And all these years,
I've been getting that for free.
Don't be smug, Leonard.
That's one of the things wrong with you.
Well, that was a successful trip.
Yes. Amy found a dress that she liked.
She sure did.
She found a dress that looked like...
...like it made her happy.
She did look happy.
I mean, her face was just glowing, so....
We should make sure
the photographer knows to really...
...get in there.
So we agree it's awful?
That dress should be set on fire.
-Should we say something?
-No, we can't.
Don't you think she brought us
because she wants our opinion?
No one wants that.
-I do.
-No, you don't.
I don't want her to look back
and think she made a mistake.
You mean like your dumb
Cookie Monster tattoo?
See, was that fun?
If someone's gonna say something,
it should be us, now...
-...instead of everyone at her wedding.
-Okay. But as long as we do it gently.
And together.
What about my dress? Don't you like it?
-I don't.
-It's beautiful.
Hey, Stuart. I'd like to sell
some comic books.
Oh, well, I know all about that.
Step one is flunk out of art school.
Why are you selling them?
The university is refusing
to fund me...
-...so I need to raise money.
-Oh. How much do you need?
For a start,
I'm trying to raise $500,000.
I hope you have that rare
Superman...
...printed on the skin of actual Superman.
I know you're making a joke,
but I have some valuable issues.
-This is the first box of many.
-Let's see what you got.
Hmm. Is this a complete run of
Todd McFarlane's
Spawn?
[SHELDON GASPS]
Yes.
Ooh. Look at this.
Giant-Size X-Men,
number one.
Len Wein's relaunch of the franchise.
Yeah, I know what it is.
I bagged it, boarded it, and taped it shut
while wearing white cotton gloves.
Okay. Well, you know I'm gonna have to
open it to assess its condition.
Just be gentle.
It's never felt the touch of a man before.
You don't seem like
you really want to sell these.
Of course I don't want to sell these.
These are all important to me.
But not as important as science.
If this is the sacrifice
I need to make, then so be it.
Okay. Why don't you leave these
and I'll price them out for you?
Is it okay if I stand here and watch?
Sure.
If anyone asks, tell them I was brave.
Hey, I can't believe you
threw me under the bus.
-I know, right? That was crazy.
-What--?
-Do you know how that makes me look?
-That's an easy one. Bad.
Why didn't you tell her?
What happened to our united front?
I'm sorry. Is this your first day being a girl?
Oh, did your mom pack your lunch?
Of course not.
Do you know how much it costs...
...to pack a tuna fish sandwich
and overnight it from Texas?
I do. And my mother says
it's too expensive.
-I like tuna fish.
-You want it? I'll sell it for $5000.
-How's the fundraising going?
-That depends. Raj, was that a yes?
-No.
-It's going badly.
How much have you raised?
With my Kickstarter campaign,
selling my collectibles...
...and the money in my bank account,
about $65,000.
Wow, that's a lot.
Not enough.
It's so frustrating that science should be
held hostage to the almighty dollar.
Don't give up.
You'll find that money somewhere.
-You think so?
-No. But it's good that he has a hobby.
Ever thought of going to Vegas?
Can you be more specific?
Las Vegas.
Oh, you mean gambling.
Oh. Well, that's not the worst idea.
It is the worst idea.
I'm including the year
that Raj wore nothing but tracksuits.
Ordinary people can't beat a casino...
...but mathematicians and scientists
do it all the time.
A group of students from MIT
took Las Vegas for millions.
And that's MIT.
Howard went there.
I'll give you a ride to the desert right now.
No one is going to Vegas.
No, we weren't gonna make it to Vegas.
Hi. Do you have a minute?
Depends.
Is what I'm wearing okay
or should I go change first?
Look, I'm sorry. I never should've said
I didn't like your dress.
It's your wedding.
All that matters is you feel beautiful.
Thank you.
So, are we good?
No, we're not good.
You ruined my dress.
Well, I just said you should wear it.
I can't wear it now.
I know you hate it.
It's all I'm gonna be thinking about.
I don't hate it.
I asked if you liked it and you said no.
There's a lot of room
between ""don't like"" and ""hate.""
It's where you find rice pudding and jazz.
Anyway, who cares what I think?
I do.
You're the coolest, prettiest,
best-dressed person in my life.
That would be flattering...
...except I know all the people in your life.
Look, Amy, I don't know what to say.
I got stuck on the fact that it's not a dress
I would choose, but it shouldn't be.
You know, it's your dress.
I mean, would you marry Leonard?
Ew.
Okay. A simple no would've been fine.
You see my point?
-That we're different people?
-Yes.
From now on, I'm gonna remember that
this wedding is all about you.
I appreciate that.
You're a good maid of honor.
[PHONE RINGING]
It's Bernadette. Hello?
I feel bad about hanging Penny out to dry.
The truth is, I don't like the dress either.
Are you kidding?
Now Bernadette doesn't like the dress?
Oh, she is the worst.
-Anyone seen Sheldon?
-Last time was this morning.
Careful. Don't say his name a third time.
You don't think he went to Las Vegas,
do you?
[BALL CLATTERING]
Five, red.
Oh. This is it.
-Is everything okay, sir?
-Oh, it's better than okay.
I'm a physicist and I've been observing
this wheel for hours...
...and running a chi-square analysis.
Which is how I know that the ball is
far more likely to land on 32, 17 or five.
If you could hold off on replacing the wheel,
I'd like to make several large bets.
Well, good for you. Pelican.
-What's pelican?
-Sir, would you come with us?
I have to place my bet.
This is for science.
-Seventeen, black.
SHELDON: No! No!
Guess who's no longer allowed
to set foot in-- Wow!
You look beautiful.
Really? Because I was gonna return it.
Why would you return it?
You look like a pile of swans.
I'm so glad you like it...
...because it's gonna be my wedding dress.
I can't wait to marry you.
Why do you smell like smoke?
I was in Vegas.
-Vegas?
-I'm sorry.
Las Vegas."

Is it nice having Sheldon and
Amy away on their honeymoon?
Yeah, because now Leonard and
I get all this alone time.
But you're not alone.
We're here.
Yes. (sighs)
Yes, you are.
BERNADETTE:
Would you like us to leave so
you and Leonard can talk about
all the things
you have in common?
LEONARD: Ha, ha, she
called your bluff.
KOOTHRAPPALI: So, something
pretty cool happened.
Channel 3 asked me to be
on the news tomorrow night
to talk about
the meteor shower.
Oh, that's great.
Hey!
Congratulations.
You know, that's how Neil
deGrasse Tyson got his start.
He went from the
Hayden Planetarium
to guesting on
the local news
to ruining everyone's
favorite movies on the Internet.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Now it's happening to me.
Ooh, I should probably
make a list
of all the scientific
inaccuracies in
Mamma Mia 2.
You're gonna go on live TV and
admit you've seen that movie?
Hey, your husband's
the one who took me.
Meryl Streep
and
Cher?
Yeah, I saw it.
(loud noise)
Sounds like
someone's in there.
My God, what if Sheldon
and Amy are getting robbed?
Or worse, what if
they're back early?
They're not; they
just posted a picture
in front of the
Statue of Liberty.
Real or Lego?
Lego.
So, what should we do?
Should someone go check it out?
I would, but I got to
be on TV tomorrow.
Got to protect the money.
Oh, yeah, someone's
definitely in there.
Okay, let's go into
our apartment.
We'll lock the door,
we'll call the pol...
Hello?! Anyone in there?!
Yes?
Oh, uh, Mr. Fowler.
Sorry, we didn't
know you were here.
We-we actually thought someone
was breaking in. (chuckles)
And we were ready
to take them down.
Amy asked me
to water her plants.
She doesn't have
any plants.
Oh.
Well, you caught me
in a lie.
Have a good day.
That was weird, right?
Was it?
I-I honestly can't tell anymore.
Hey, did you even see
Mamma Mia 1?
Didn't need to.
The sequel stands on its own.
Here you go.
If you need any recommendations
while visiting New York,
please don't hesitate
to contact me.
Well, it is our honeymoon.
So we are going
to be quite busy.
Got it.
Harry Potter
play,
parts one and two.
And tomorrow,
a tour of the sites
where Nikola Tesla lived,
worked and slowly went crazy.
And, of course, coitus.
Ah.
Well, enjoy New York.
And, I guess, coitus.
Really, Sheldon?
You want to do it again?
Don't act surprised.
It's clearly marked
on the schedule.
Now,
shall we steam the wrinkles
out of our wizard robes,
or make vigorous,
socially sanctioned love?
Either way, I can check
something off my to-do list.
Socially sanc-- Oh, wow.
Yeah, there it is right there.
Uh, hurry.
Raj is on next.
All right. I can't believe
they canceled
Vampire Diaries
but they'll show this.
This is the news.
And that was a woman torn
between two hunky vampires.
What is your point?
(pounding on door across hall)
MRS. FOWLER:
Larry? I know you're in there!
Is that Amy's mom?
MRS. FOWLER:
Let me in.
(shouting):
Let me in!
Either that or the Big Bad Wolf.
Larry?
Mrs. Fowler,
are you okay?
Oh, I'm okay. It's my husband
you should worry about.
Oh, we do.
(knocks)
Larry, come on.
I don't think he's in there.
I mean, he came by to water
the imaginary plants,
but then he left.
You are so naive.
Blondie here is gonna
chew you up and spit you out.
Well, don't tell him.
Come on, you have an extra key.
Open it up.
All right,
but I'm telling you
he's not in there.
There. See?
Oh, he's in here.
I can smell his Axe body spray.
He wears Axe body spray.
You happy? You smell
like Amy's dad.
Larry?
Ooh, come on.
Ah, shouldn't we mind
our own business?
Wow, sometimes it's like
you don't know me at all.
See, he's not here.
You don't know him
like I do.
To be fair, we don't
know either of you.
Satisfied?
Oh, yeah, now I smell him.
Man, that is one
hot weather girl.
How come if I say that
I get in trouble?
You want to say it?
You can say it.
Nice try.
You're gonna have to find
some other way
to not have sex
with me tonight.
And it's not weather girl,
it's weather
woman.
(scoffs)
And with us today
to talk about
the upcoming meteor shower and
the best places to view it,
Caltech astrophysicist
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.
Thank you for being here.
Thank you for having me.
I guess Neil deGrasse Tyson
was unavailable.
(laughs)
Yeah.
What do you mean, ""yeah""?
Not important.
So, what can we expect
to see from
this meteor shower?
Well, I think you can count
on a lot of flaming gas,
which is what
you would have gotten
from your first choice,
Neil deGrasse Tyson.
Pull up, Raj, pull up!
Sounds like there's no love lost
between you and Dr. Tyson.
Oh, no, I love Neil.
I mean, not as much as Neil
loves Neil, but who does, right?
(chuckling)
I want to look away,
but I can't.
Oh, you know, I'm told we
are out of time, (chuckles)
having learned nothing
about meteor showers
and too much about
Dr. Koothrappali.
Thank you.
Do you know what I love
about Broadway theater?
It's so interactive.
Uh-huh.
You're so close to the actors.
It's like you're in the play.
Uh-huh.
I mean, you yell,
""Harry, watch out,""
he looks right at you.
And not just Harry,
everyone onstage.
At the risk of sounding
redundant, uh-huh.
All right, well,
it's a bit late,
but I did block out
the rest of the evening
for conjugal relations.
Should we shower?
I mean before, not during.
That's how you fall
and break a hip.
You know,
I'm a little jet-laggy.
Maybe we can revisit this
in the morning.
Oh, no can do.
If we miss tonight,
it's not scheduled
until Thursday at 6:00.
And that'll have
to be ""no frills,""
'cause we've got a 6:30
reservation at Benihana.
Sheldon, do we really
have to do this on a schedule?
Are you suggesting spontaneity?
I-I guess, yeah.
So, now that we're married,
sex can occur at any time?
Like, we can be
brushing our teeth,
and suddenly your minty-fresh
tongue is in my mouth?
No, thank you.
Really? Would it be so bad
to mix it up a little?
Mix it up?
Who are you, Betty Crocker?
Where are you going?
Uh, to take a shower.
Now that sex can happen
at any time,
I always have to be ready.
Should probably live
under a waterfall.
Well, you don't have to worry
about sex happening tonight.
Oh. Well, thanks,
but I'm still gonna rinse off.
I touched a lot of stuff
in the gift shop.
No message, no note.
Who would do that?
What kind of
husband would...
If you let him talk,
maybe you'll find out.
Fine. Larry?
Well, there you go.
What more can he say?
Let's go home.
I think I'll stay.
Well, if you're going to stay,
then I'll stay.
All right, well, you know
who doesn't need to stay?
Us. Come on.
Penny, come on.
Aw.
I don't think those two
are gonna make it.
Poor Mr. Fowler, I really feel
sorry for the little guy.
I know. After they had Amy,
she should've just eaten him
and been done with it.
Look at you retaining facts
from a nature show. (chuckles)
I know, really,
what did he ever see in her?
He's so, so sweet, and
she's such a ballbuster.
Some guys think
strong women are sexy.
Yeah, but they seem to have
nothing in common.
Yeah, well, sometimes
opposites attract.
Wait, are-are you saying
we are like them?
I don't know, maybe a little.
So you're the sweet, quiet one
and I'm Amy's mom?
Is that what you're saying?
Hey, check out what Neil
deGrasse Tyson just tweeted.
""I've been informed
that some random,
attention-seeking nobody
took a cheap shot at me
on the local news.""
That's me.
Guys, he's talking about me!
You know, I cut you
a lot of slack
'cause you come
from another country,
but you've been here
a long time.
Raj, you need to apologize
to Dr. Tyson.
Why? This could be good for me.
Everybody loves
a good Twitter feud.
Neil and I
could be like
the new, uh, Katy Perry
and Taylor Swift.
Come on, Raj,
you're better than this.
Oh, leave room for dessert
'cause I'm gonna
make you eat those words.
(clears throat)
""Dear Dr. Tyson,
""much like epithelial tissue,
it appears I've gotten
under your skin.""
iPhone drop,
but I won't
'cause I don't have AppleCare.
(phone chimes)
What'd he say?
""Nice try, genius.
The skin
is
epithelial tissue.""
Oh, it's on.
He's Katy, I'm T-Swift.
(clears throat)
What are you gonna do?
He's from another country.
TOUR GUIDE: And here we have
the former hotel where Tesla
perfected the three-phase
alternating current motor.
That's wrong.
I'm gonna say something.
Don't.
Well, then how will everyone
know I'm the smartest boy here?
Just let it go.
Is everything all right?
You seem testy
this morning.
I'm not testy.
I'll have to take
your word for it.
There's no test for testy.
Is it possible that
you're sexually frustrated?
Okay, now I'm testy.
If you had adhered
to my coital schedule,
your brain would be floating
on a sea of oxytocin right now.
Don't talk to me about my brain.
I'm a neurobiologist.
Then you should know
the benefits of the special hug
that grown-ups
give each other.
Sheldon, everybody's
listening.
Of course they're listening;
we're interesting.
Unlike that guy.
I-I'm walking
away from you.
I'm only
recently married.
Do I stay here? Do I follow?
Say something useful.
Morning, sunshine.
So I see you're making espresso.
Yup.
Just need that extra jolt
for a successful day
of ballbusting.
Really? I don't,
I don't think you do.
You know, you compared us to
the strangest couple we know,
and we know
Amy and Sheldon,
Howard and Bernadette,
Raj and his twitchy little dog.
I-I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
Because it wasn't nice
or because it wasn't true?
It's not true. (stammers)
Mrs. Fowler is an angry,
vindictive woman,
whereas you are warm
and-and loving,
quick to forgive.
Oh, please.
I-I'm serious.
And I'm nothing like Amy's dad.
He's a mousy little man
who can't stand up for himself.
My point is you're not like her,
so we're not like them.
Well, 30 years from now,
are you gonna hide from me
because I'm so scary?
Hey, I-I don't think
you're scary.
Yes, I flinch when
you make sudden moves, but...
...that says more about
my childhood than you.
Aw.
Your turn.
Hang on, I'm checking
to see if Neil replied
to my latest
smackdown.
Really? Don't you think this
Twitter feud is a little silly?
Absolutely not.
It's-it's two
respected scientists
debating opposing views
in a public forum.
You called him
Mike Tyson's little sister.
Yeah, and now Mike Tyson's
mad at me, too.
Raj, you're not going to impress
anyone by attacking him.
Oh, Bernadette,
you sound so old right now.
He said he needs a break,
and I'm too much for him.
Oh. I'm sure he
didn't mean that.
He said I'm overbearing!
Oh, please, you're just
the right amount of bearing.
Look, I know he loves you.
If you just give him some space,
I'm sure he'll come back.
You really think so?
Yeah, I do.
You're a good person, Penny.
I hope we get to spend
lots of time together.
Me, too.
Yes?
Hit the road.
But...
Now!
Can I get my stuff?
Be quick about it!
(whimpers)
Hello.
Hello.
I brought you two hot dogs.
A-Aren't you
gonna eat one?
From a street cart?
Are you crazy?
I'm amazed that
I'm holding them.
I'm not really hungry.
You realize that I'm not
a particularly physical person.
I know.
When I was little,
and people asked me what
I wanted to be when I grew up,
I'd always say,
""A brain in a jar.""
Sure.
Yeah, but I want to be
a good husband to you,
and intimacy
is a part of that.
Please put those down.
I'm just worried
that if I don't schedule
our bedroom endeavors,
then I may not think about them,
and you'll grow
cold and distant
and seek solace in the arms of
a heavily-muscled longshoreman.
Where would I find
a longshoreman?
Along the shore.
It's in the name.
Sheldon, I could never be
with anybody but you.
That's good to know.
I wouldn't want
to fight a man
who's brave enough
to touch a fish.
How's this for
a compromise?
Make all the schedules you want,
just don't tell me about them.
Excellent.
I'll create an algorithm
that'll generate
a pseudo-random schedule.
Yeah, and do you know why
it won't be a true
random schedule?
Because the generation
of true random numbers
remains an unsolved problem
in computer science.
Come with me.
Where are we going?
To the hotel room.
And when we get there,
I'm gonna need you
to say that again,
except naked.
(gasps)
(ringtone playing)
Go for Dr. K.
NEIL deGRASSE TYSON:
Is this Rajesh Koothrappali?
Yes. Who is this?
Neil deGrasse Tyson.
(stammers) Uh, w-wow.
(chuckles)
How fun is this
Twitter thing, huh?
You think you're funny?
I'm-I'm not Seinfeld funny, but
I did an open mic night once.
You're not funny.
Yeah, that's what they said
at the Chuckle Hut.
How about this:
I've got a book signing at
Vroman's in Pasadena next week.
Why don't you come by and say
some of those things to my face.
(chuckles):
Oh, no,
but thanks for the invite.
Smart move, and the next time
you pick up your phone,
remember, I'm the guy who kicked
Pluto out of the solar system.
And it deserved it, sir.
Thank you. Bye-bye.
Well, that was fun.
Let's see who else needs
a deGrasse kickin'.
Bill Nye the Science Guy.
Hey, Bill, Neil Tyson.
We've got to talk."
s11ep23.xml,"That's not right.
No, that's so unreasonable!
If you're going to be like this,
I don't wanna talk to you now either!
Okay, I love you. Bye.
Amazon customer support?
No, my mother. Guess who she's insisting
we invite to our wedding.
Jesus?
If only.
My brother.
Wait, you didn't invite your brother
to your own wedding?
He tormented me my whole childhood.
I don't think I should reward that behavior...
...with a slice of wedding cake
in the shape of the
Millennium Falcon.
Try again.
A slice of wedding cake
in the shape of a cake.
Look, he may have been mean to you when you
were kids, but you're both grown men now.
That's right. I'm a grown-up and if I don't
wanna invite him to my wedding, then I won't.
-Okay.
-Except I have to...
...because my mommy's making me.
Okay, so each welcome bag gets a schedule
of events, a map, and chocolate from me.
And from Sheldon, a bottle of Purell...
...the number for Poison Control in case
someone accidentally drinks the Purell...
...and a laminated table of elements because
the American school system is a failure.
How many out-of-town guests
are there gonna be?
I'm not sure.
Turns out Sheldon didn't invite his brother.
Hmm.
Now it's starting to sound like a wedding.
His mom said she won't come
if his brother's not there.
Now it's starting to sound
like a good wedding.
HOWARD:
Hey, Bernie? Hey.
How do you know if someone has pink eye?
Their eye would be red, swollen
and probably oozy.
Okay, thanks. Heh.
Both kids have pink eye.
-Oh, no!
-You stop right there!
I'm getting married in a week.
You are not giving me pink eye.
-I don't have pink eye.
-Hey, hey, hey! Step away from the bride.
-Okay. I'll go back upstairs.
-Get in the shower...
-...and then take those clothes and burn them.
-Yeah, and all the rest of your clothes.
Eh. Worth a shot.
Am I gonna be like the only single guy
at Sheldon's wedding?
No, there will be a lot of single people there.
Stuart, Amy's great-aunt.
Although, Stuart's already friended her
on Facebook, so better move quick.
I've gotta find a date. I don't wanna be that
sad single friend everyone looks at with pity.
Uh.... I'm afraid that ship may have sailed.
Leonard.
-You have a brother, right?
-Yes.
Is he the worst?
An unspeakable abomination?
Does the very thought of him
make your skin crawl?
Well, he laughs at his own jokes,
but otherwise he's okay.
Sheldon, what's going on?
I'm trying to invite my stupid brother
to my wedding and he's avoiding my calls.
You don't know he's avoiding your calls.
[LINE RINGS THEN CLICKS]
You've reached George Cooper,
please leave a message.
Unless this is Sheldon...
...in which case please try me
on my other number, 1-800-suck-it.
See?
And I know that's not a real number
because why would it be toll-free?
Sheldon, you tried.
What more could you have done?
-Why didn't you invite him in the first place?
-You don't know what it was like with him.
I get it, I grew up with lots of brothers.
-My brother Adoot was especially mean.
-I've never heard you mention Adoot.
Sure I have. He's the one
who left the door open when we were kids...
...and my pet mongoose ran away.
Stupid Adoot!
Short of getting on a plane and flying there,
what does your mother expect you to do?
I kept saying no. How am I here?
Did I tell you? I found a date.
-To the wedding?
-To coffee.
But if things go well,
Sheldon and Amy's wedding.
Aren't you worried it's a little intense to ask
someone you just met to go to a wedding?
I'm running out of time.
Why can't there be a service...
...where you can pay someone
to be your date for the evening?
Like an escort service?
No, no, you wouldn't be paying for sex.
I mean, obviously if things went well
it could lead to sex.
But the money is for her time
and companionship.
Oh, I get it.
An escort service.
Stop saying that.
Stop meaning it.
HOWARD: Hey, Raj, remember when you
borrowed my VR goggles the other day?
Yeah.
Probably shouldn't have done that.
LEONARD:
So, wait, your brother is Dr. Tire?
Yes, and apparently...
...it only takes half a semester of community
college to get that particular doctorate.
We passed three of these stores
on the way here.
Why did you say
he's just ""some loser who sells tires""?
You're right, that was unfair.
He's a loser who sells more tires
than anyone in Texas.
Oh, excuse me,
we're looking for Georgie Cooper.
One second,
I'll check to see if the doctor's in.
He is not a doctor.
Only one doctor here and it's me.
I'm also a doctor.
You wanna wait in the car?
I wanted to wait in California.
So is this Georgie?
Yes.
And what is he even using
that stethoscope to listen to?
I don't know, small leak?
All right, that makes sense.
What the hell are you doing here?
-Hello, Georgie.
-It's just George now.
Fine, George.
No, I don't like it. Georgie.
-I see you haven't changed one bit.
-Thank you, that is a nice thing to say.
Hey, I'm Leonard. I'm here for-- For no reason.
What do you want, Sheldon?
Why aren't you returning my phone calls?
You're supposed to be the smart one,
you figure it out.
He's not that kind of smart.
You might wanna give him a hint.
We haven't talked in over 10 years...
...and now you need something,
you think you can show up?
Let's just drop everything
to accommodate Sheldon.
Nice try,
but I'm not a gullible little boy anymore.
I can recognize sarcasm.
Okay, you're right.
I'm sorry, tell me what you need.
Your wish is my command.
That's better, thank you.
[SKYPE TONES CHIMING]
Oh, my God!
Yeah, I got it too.
You really can't keep your hands
off Howard, can you?
I know, I have a problem.
I just wanted to make sure
you and Amy didn't get it.
Well, I didn't get it.
You infected me a week before my wedding!
What am I supposed to do about this?
Wear a veil?
[LAUGHS]
That's not funny.
-Look at what you've done to me!
-Hey!
Could you just, like, not touch my computer
or, like, anything else? I just-- Ugh.
I don't wanna look like that
in your wedding photos.
There aren't gonna be any wedding photos.
My fiancé's a germaphobe.
If he finds out I'm contagious,
he'll never come back from Texas.
What if we tell him the theme of the wedding
is
Walking Dead...
...and this is our zombie makeup?
That'll work. We'll call that plan B.
Well, ahem...
...turns out this is gonna come in handy
after all.
Hold up, I'm confused.
You didn't want me at your wedding,
but now that Mom won't come...
...you want me there?
I know you don't hear this a lot,
but that is exactly right. Good job.
Not helping, Sheldon.
Listen here.
You want me at your wedding,
all you gotta do is ask nicely.
[SIGHS]
-Georgie--
-George.
[GRUNTS]
I would like you at my wedding.
Thank you, Sheldon. That is so nice to hear.
But I would rather swallow a pregnant wildcat
and crap out a litter of kittens!
It is fitting that you got into tires
because you are tiresome.
Sheldon, come on.
-Was that too mean?
-No, not too mean. Not too good either.
No, Mother, that's not fair.
But he told--
Yes, ma'am.
But I said--
Yes, ma'am.
Goodbye.
What did she say?
She's not getting in the middle of it because we
""boys needs to work it out ourselves.''
Maybe it's fine
if she doesn't come to the wedding.
I've got Amy now and she can do
everything a mom can do and more.
Say that to her on the wedding night,
really spice things up.
This is all Georgie's fault.
My whole childhood he was mean to me.
Sorry, I know what it's like
to live with a bully.
Your brother bullied you?
Oh, I was talking about Penny, but sure.
Once when I was 8, I was going to dress
as my favorite scientist for Halloween...
...and Georgie threw my costume away.
I had to wear a sheet and go as a ghost.
Scared myself all night long.
Well, look, we don't fly out
until the morning.
Why don't I try and talk to him,
give it one more shot?
All right.
But if he says, ""Nerd says what?""
don't answer him.
-What?
-You are a lamb to the slaughter.
So how was your date?
It was going well
until my eye dripped in her latte.
We're so sorry we ruined your date.
Oh, boo-hoo.
His date got ruined.
I'm about to get married and look at me.
-It looks like it's getting better.
-Oh, does it?
Does it look like that
with your two clear eyes?
I'm sorry, are you mad
that I don't have pink eye?
AMY: What do you think?
ALL: Yes!
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay.
Listen, I hear you.
I know they're pricey,
but these are the Dallas Cowboys of tires.
Okay? And we're talking
the Troy Aikman Cowboys...
...not that pretty boy Tony Romo.
All right, good call, you won't regret it.
-Boom!
-Wow, that was impressive.
Yeah, well, it's easy when you
love your product and hate Tony Romo.
Yeah, that guy's the--
Actually, I don't know who that guy is.
If you are here about Sheldon's wedding,
don't bother.
Come on.
I know you two have your differences.
-You mean pretty much everything about us?
-Not everything. You're both tall...
...you have the same last name....
Maybe I shouldn't have started this
like it was a list.
You have no idea
what you are talking about.
Ooh. There, that was very Sheldon.
Look, I'm sure
he was not the easiest brother to have...
...but it wasn't easy for him either
with you picking on him all the time.
[LAUGHS]
Picking on him? Is that what he told you?
What about the time
you threw away his Halloween costume?
Well, yeah, because he was gonna dress
as some girl scientist.
Madame Curie?
Oh, I didn't know she was a madame.
But he was still gonna get beat up
for wearing that dress.
Didn't you sit on his head
while he tried to watch
Star Trek?
Well, yeah, but that was hilarious.
That is pretty hilarious, yeah.
Look, I always looked out for him
at school...
...I drove him everywhere,
I apologized to people when he was rude.
Yeah, I've done all that.
I've also removed all the red balloons
from his Lucky Charms...
...because they weren't ""Irish enough.""
So you know what I'm talking about.
And has he ever thanked you?
Not in so many words.
Or any words.
Would it kill him to actually say it?
No. No, it wouldn't kill him.
Leonard...
...you know how I got the money
to open up my first store?
I busted my ass for it. All the extra money
we had, had to go to Sheldon...
...so he could go to college
and he could go study in Germany.
And you know what he's never said to me?
[SPEAKS IN GERMAN]
It's ""thank you"" in German.
Do you need me to sit on your head?
Nope.
After all my sacrifices, guess which kid
my mom is the most proud of.
If it makes you feel any better,
my mom's the most proud of Sheldon too.
Leonard, you want a beer?
-I would love a beer.
-There you go.
-Can you open it for me?
-It's a twist-off.
I know.
Hey, I got all the beads to the other side.
It's not a puzzle, Penny.
Do you really wanna be touching that?
Do you know how many sick kids--?
Never mind, knock yourself out.
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
Bernadette says
they're checking the kids now.
Maybe we didn't all need to come.
Hey, whatever kind of pink eye their kids have,
I have, and I need to know.
And if it's viral, I'm screwed.
Maybe not.
I know it's not traditional wedding attire...
...but how about a welder's mask?
If you know a welder,
that could be your ""something borrowed.""
Great news! It's bacterial.
Oh, yes!
-Yes!
-Yeah!
What are you doing? Wash your hands!
Not you.
Hello, room service.
I'm calling about the club sandwich
on your menu.
No, I don't want one.
I just want you to spell it correctly.
Unless the ""club"" is the Poor Typing Club.
Okay. Now let's discuss
this ""15 percent gratooty.""
Well, that was rude.
Someone just lost their gratooty.
Sheldon, you need to apologize
to your brother.
-I'm sorry?
LEONARD: Yes.
Like that, but nicer, and that way.
I have nothing to apologize for.
Ha. Told you this was a bad idea.
Sometimes you can't patch a tire,
you just gotta buy a new one.
Actually, that's always the case.
Never patch, buy new.
While I appreciate your folksy tire wisdom...
...I don't appreciate
what you're putting Mom through.
What would you know about Mom?
You were never home.
This is good. Get it all out.
-Not now!
-Shut up!
You went away to college after Dad died,
who do you think took care of everything?
Mom did.
Mom always took care of everything.
Mom was a mess, Missy was a dumb teenager.
I had to look after both of them.
I talked to Mom all the time.
If she was upset, she would have told me.
She was protecting you, you idiot,
just like everyone always does.
If things were bad,
then why didn't you tell me?
Because I was protecting you too.
You're my baby brother, Sheldon.
I know life has been hard for you...
...but that don't mean it's been easy
for the rest of us.
I suppose I didn't think
about how it was for everyone else.
Well, that's all right.
I know you didn't.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
And it would mean a lot to me
to have my big brother at my wedding.
I wouldn't miss it.
Is it me, or did we just patch a tire?
He said never patch. Do you even listen?
[SKYPE TONES CHIMING]
Hey, how's it going?
Really good.
Georgie's going to come to the wedding.
Oh, that's great.
Why aren't you looking at the camera?
You know, I'm just working
on my peripheral vision.
Well, that is nonsense.
Your peripheral vision is fine.
Are those women's magazines
making you feel bad about yourself again?
Yep, that is what's happening.
I've told you before,
those women are airbrushed...
...to make it look like they have good vision.
Hey, I was thinking...
...now that you and your brother made up,
there's no reason to rush home.
You know, maybe you and Leonard...
...could stay for...
...two to three more fun-filled days there.
That's a great idea.
Hey, Leonard, good news.
We do have time
to visit the Museum of the American Railroad.
I'd say no, but what's the point.
Ooh. You might not wanna get too close.
Pink eye.
-Me too!
-Oh.
-Bacterial?
-Yeah.
-Same!
-Ha-ha-ha.
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but...
...would you be interested
in going to a wedding with me?"
s11ep12.xml,"Hey, can you do me a favor?
Can we try to avoid talking to our friends
tonight about our wedding plans?
I'll do you one better.
I'll avoid talking to our friends
entirely and play on my phone.
I haven't picked a maid of honor
and I'm having trouble...
-...deciding between Penny and Bernadette.
-Understandable, they are quite similar.
Both blond former waitresses
who married beneath them.
Penny is my best friend
but I was Bernadette's maid of honor...
...and I think she expects it.
So if anyone brings it up tonight,
maybe you can help me change the subject.
How about this: I dominate the conversation
so hard no one has a chance...
...to get a word in edgewise.
I don't know, they might see that coming.
-What if we have a code word?
-Oh, now you're speaking my catamaran.
That's my code word for language.
Okay, fine, catamaran, that's our code word.
No. That's my code word, get your own.
Okay, uh, ""pretzels.""
You hear me say pretzels,
you change the subject.
Rhinos are my least favorite
animals at the zoo.
What?
I'm sorry, I thought we started.
Just hold the gate still
while I screw it in.
I don't know
how I feel about all this baby-proofing.
If Halley can't teach herself
to walk down stairs...
...maybe that's nature's way of saying
the Wolowitz line ends here.
That's funny, I thought Howard
was nature's way of saying...
...the Wolowitz line ends here.
Me too, but life does find a way!
Hey, Halley can't reach the liquor cabinet.
Why did you baby-proof it?
How did you know we did?
Fair point.
Bernadette still going stir crazy?
A little. Two months of bed rest
is kind of rough.
Really?
That sounds great, how do I get that?
You'd either have to break your hip
or let Howard knock you up.
Either way,
you'll get flowers the next morning.
She's actually been keeping herself busy
doing wedding research for you.
Oh, she doesn't have to do that.
She wants to.
After all, you were her maid of honor.
Sheldon, tell your funny story
about pretzels.
Oh, right. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Did you know that we've been thinking
of having pretzels at our wedding?
No, no, no. I'm sorry, no. Rhinos.
We're having rhinos at our wedding.
No. I gotta go.
I'm gonna need some help.
Someone baby-proofed the front door.
Sheldon, what am I gonna do
about my maid of honor?
I mean, Bernadette gave me
all these bridal magazines.
She even folded down
the pages with the good dresses.
I get it. Yeah.
Leonard once borrowed my
Edmund Scientific catalog...
...and dog-eared some pages.
Never got them straight again.
Well, that is exactly the same thing.
You really understand my dilemma.
Actually, I do.
My mother is pushing for my brother...
...Georgie, to be my best man.
I hate to disappoint her again.
I already rejected her savior
and her LinkedIn invitation.
How are we gonna make these decisions
without anybody getting upset?
Well, what if we take emotion
out of the process...
...and base it on empirical metrics?
Then we aren't really making the decision,
the data is.
So we can hurt our friends' feelings
without taking any responsibility?
Me likey.
But how do we apply
quantitative metrics to something...
...as subjective
as choosing a wedding party?
That decision only seems subjective.
In reality, people in a wedding party
perform very specific functions...
...and some will perform better than others.
If I may use a superhero analogy--
-You may not.
-Okay, I'll use real people.
If a certain dog-like loyalty is useful,
it's Leonard.
If having a Pez dispenser filled with Tums
is an advantage, Wolowitz.
If a best man
with fake testicles hanging from his truck...
...is important,
my brother's back in the running.
Okay, I see your point.
So we break down each of the roles
into their component parts and then design...
...specialized tests for each.
Exactly. Boy, if I had known getting married
was going to involve so much science...
...I'd have proposed years ago.
-So, Leonard, tell everyone your news.
LEONARD: Oh.
I'm starting a book.
That would be big news from Penny,
but you've read a book before.
He means he's writing a book.
I do. It's something
I've been thinking about for a long time.
Yeah. It's about a brilliant physicist
who solves crimes using science.
-Oh, Leonard--
-It's not about you.
He probably has to say that
for legal reasons.
Uh-oh. They gave us plain rice
instead of fried rice.
No fair, I SoulCycled this morning
I'm entitled to a pile of fat rice.
Well, I would say
this constitutes a catering crisis.
I agree. Who's gonna step up
and handle it?
It doesn't matter, this is fine.
-Penny?
-What?
You know what, I'll take care of it.
[IN CHINESE]
-[IN ENGLISH] Done.
-You didn't make him feel bad, did you?
Actually, he was laughing. Heh, heh.
I'm really impressed
at how you handled that, Howard.
Please, I've been sending food back
my entire life.
One of my first full sentences was,
''I had breastmilk for breakfast.""
Excuse me, before we start eating,
I would like to make a toast.
LEONARD: Oh, nice.
-If only I could think of one.
Someone else go.
Here's the sewing kit you asked for.
Oh, a minute nineteen, quick.
You were timing me?
Yes, I am going through
a bit of a timing phase.
How long will it last? We'll find out.
What did you need the kit for?
Oh, um....
Sheldon was squatting down
to pick up a fork and he ripped his pants.
Someone's gonna be sore tomorrow.
Quick thinking, but for future lies...
...this is as far as I can squat.
Penny gets 20 points for the sewing kit.
Yeah, minus five because this is mine.
-Well, she's still pulling a commanding lead.
-Did Bernadette try to send us a sewing kit?
She did. Amazon,
standard shipping, not even Prime.
-We could've done that ourselves.
-Heh, that's what she said.
Maybe we're being old-fashioned,
defining these roles by gender.
You know, historically, the best man's role
was to defend the bride and groom in combat.
I mean, if that's not Penny,
I don't know what we're doing here.
I see your point.
Okay, we are officially open
to a best woman and a gentleman of honor.
Oh, those names are terrible.
One point off for you.
What am I being tested for?
Oh, it's not important.
But if you don't pass, none of this matters.
Okay. What's the next test?
Loyalty.
We need to choose someone
who has our backs.
Someone who will keep our secrets
even from each other.
Well, I don't have any secrets from you.
Do you have secrets from me?
Yes.
Oh, that has been weighing on me for years.
Come here.
Would you call yourself a loyal
and trustworthy friend?
I like to think so.
Great. Because I need to tell you
something about Howard...
...but you can't tell him I told you.
Nope. Don't want to hear it.
Do not like to engage in gossip.
Okay, I respect your integrity.
Is it about his special underwear?
I already know. That's all I'll say.
Fine, it has a charcoal filter in it.
It's sweet of you
to come by and keep me company.
Agreed.
So listen,
I have a secret I need to tell someone.
But you can never say a word.
Not even to Howard.
I'm your girl, lay it on me.
Really? You keep things
from your husband?
No, I tell him everything.
Don't be a child.
Okay, here it is.
I can control the thermostat
in Leonard's apartment with my phone.
And when he makes me mad,
I turn it up slightly.
Oh. Hey, I didn't know you were here.
What are you two talking about?
Literally nothing interesting.
Oh, you're good.
Okay, getting to the ceremony on time.
Leonard, quick. I need you
to get me to Arcadia within the hour.
-The train store's having a sale.
-Why can't Amy drive you?
Because of the tradition that I cannot see
Amy on the day of the train store sale.
Please, please see a doctor.
-Next test--
-Wait one second.
Is it getting hot in here?
[LAUGHS]
I'm sorry, where were we?
How well do our friends know us?
-So I was talking to my favorite aunt--
-Aunt Doe, right?
Exactly.
Did she ever figure out
what that thing on her knee was?
Turns out it was a chocolate chip.
Hm. Makes sense, she does like to bake.
AMY: Yes, she does--
Damn, you are a thoroughbred.
You know, dealing with cold feet
is an important part...
...of being both
best man and maid of honor.
Maybe we should test for that ability.
You really think you might get cold feet?
Actually, I was talking about you.
Amy, if there's one thing
in this world I'm sure of...
...you are right to be worried.
Good night.
Howard, I've had my eye
on this limited edition Swamp Thing...
...but now that I'm about to buy it,
I'm having second thoughts.
What do you think?
I don’t know, Sheldon, it's pretty expensive.
Yes, but what if it will make me happy,
waking up and seeing it every morning...
...for the rest of my life?
Really, a walking clump of swamp grass?
Yeah, well, Bernadette's no prize either!
Hey, what you doing?
Sheldon gave me a brain teaser.
It's kind of fun.
It's about a group of people
at dinner and you have to figure out...
...where they can sit without fighting.
Oh, yeah, is this the one where Mr. Green
can't sit next to anyone eating meat...
...and Uncle Light Blue
won't sit next to any of the darker colors?
Yeah, did Sheldon send it to you?
Amy did, I solved it already.
-Really?
-Yeah. Same way I solved...
...my jury duty summons. I threw it away.
No, no, no. Aunt Orange can't sit
next to the bar without Ms. Pink saying:
""Jesus thinks you've had enough whiskey.""
Did Sheldon and Amy
give you guys that puzzle too?
Yeah. Is it just me
or have they been acting strange?
I don't think they're acting.
Sheldon made me take him to the train store.
We didn't go inside.
He just said, ""Nicely done""
and then we went home.
Yeah, and Amy gave me this plastic ring
and told me to hold onto it.
-I got one too.
-Yeah, same.
Yeah, me too. But Cinnamon ate it.
I'll get it back tomorrow.
-I have to say, this is going pretty well.
-It is.
If experimenting on humans
is morally wrong...
...then I don't wanna be morally right.
Hey, are you testing us
to see who gets to be in your wedding?
SHELDON: Yes.
-No.
They're rating us.
And I'm in last?
Don't panic, there's still time.
Look, it's a marathon, not a sprint.
Know what? This is insulting.
I don't wanna be your stupid best man.
PENNY: Yeah.
HOWARD: Me either.
Wait. Just out of curiosity,
which one of you figured it out?
I did.
Impressive.
Hello, Stuart.
Hey, Sheldon,
can I interest you in a cappuccino?
When did you start selling those?
Someone left it here, but it's still warm.
Wanna say four bucks?
No, thank you.
Everything okay?
Well, I secretly experimented on my friends...
...and now none of them
want to be my best man.
So, you know, normal wedding drama.
-Sorry.
-Probably have to use my stupid brother.
So get ready for a wedding toast
delivered by his armpit.
If you really don't wanna use your brother,
I'd be your best man.
-Really?
-Yeah. We're friends.
Plus, it'd be nice.
Never really been called ""the best"" before.
Or a man, for that matter.
Okay, well, thank you, Stuart.
That's a very generous offer.
My pleasure.
I understand the best man
usually receives a present?
That's true.
You can never have too much Claritin.
Are you still working on Sheldon's
dumb brain teaser?
Oh, my God, Dr. Purple's a woman.
Of course!
That feels so good.
Hello.
I believe I owe the three of you an apology.
No argument here.
By experimenting on you...
...I realize I have violated your trust.
And possibly the Geneva Convention.
Is that it?
No. So as to not upset any of you further,
I've asked Stuart to be my best man...
...and he's agreed.
You're all still invited to the bachelor party.
He's thinking Costco
and the theme is browsing.
You picked Stuart over one of us?
Well, I wanted to choose one of you,
but you all turned against me.
Picking a best man
isn't about keeping score.
But you're all my friends.
If I didn't collect data,
how could I possibly choose...
...among the three of you?
That's actually kind of sweet.
Is it? Perhaps I said it wrong.
Look, this is your wedding.
Just pick whoever you want.
You don't need to worry about
anyone else but yourself.
You've kind of been training for this
your whole life.
Thank you, Leonard.
And if it helps, these two are quitters.
What are you making?
Well, I spilled the cheese packet,
so we're having mac and nothing.
Yeah, I'll just have the mac.
Nothing gives me gas.
Why are you in such a good mood?
I just talked to Sheldon.
He apologized about the tests...
...and asked me to be his best man.
Great. After all you've done for him
he should've asked you.
And Amy's your best friend, I'm sure
she'll come to her senses and pick you.
She's not my best friend, we're not 12.
If she wants Bernadette to be
her maid of honor, I really don't care.
Sounds like you care.
No. I mean, it's just annoying.
We talk every day,
we see each other all the time...
...she's always there for me and basically--
Oh, my God, Amy's my best friend.
You okay?
No, my best friend didn't ask me
to be her maid of honor. I'm pissed!
So bottom line,
what you did was wrong and cruel...
...which the mother of my children
finds oddly appealing.
So she still wants to be my maid of honor?
Maid of honor, hit woman,
whatever you need. Make the call.
I know this is your wedding
and you can do whatever you want...
...but if you think anyone but me
is gonna be your maid of honor...
...then you're an idiot,
because you are my best friend.
-Too late, Bernadette--
-Bestie!
Stuart, I'm sorry if it's weird Sheldon
made me best man instead of you.
It's okay,
I was best man for two whole days.
No one can take that away from me.
Except for Sheldon, when he did.
Although if you wanna be
a part of the wedding party...
...I suppose you could be the flower girl.
Sold.
I thought Halley was gonna be
the flower girl.
Oh, that's much better.
Sorry, Stuart, you're out.
Is Bernadette okay
with me being maid of honor?
Actually, I haven't had the courage
to tell her.
-I guess I should do that.
-Yeah. Ahem.
Although, as maid of honor,
your job is to make my life easier.
Ugh. Damn it.
Hey, Stuart,
you still want in on this wedding?
Not that much.
Fine, I'll do it.
But do me a favor
and unlock the liquor cabinet first."
s11ep13.xml,"Hey. Look what I've got, everybody.
Newspapers?
Did you find a portal back to the 1990s?
No, if he had that, he'd be trying to prevent

Please, I'm glad they broke up...
...otherwise Justin would never
have brought sexy back.

Heh, heh.
Well, I don't get that one.
-He's pushing when he should be pulling.
-Mm.
Well, I don't think he belongs
in a gifted school then.
What are you doing?
Making a boat.
When I was a kid, my dad showed me how.
Boy, you'll do anything to avoid reading.
Hey, guys. It's under
""Things to Do This Weekend.""
I can't find it. What does it say?
That it's a thing to do this weekend.
That's great, Raj. Congratulations.
While we're bragging,
the
Journal of Prosthetic Medicine...
...just wrote up the project
Howard and I are working on.
You didn't tell me that.
It just came out.
It's just a little blurb.
Oh. Well, good for you.
Bert and I have started isolating zircons
from meteorites for our dark matter search.
Well, how nice.
Everyone is doing impressive work.
-What have you been working on these days?
-Whoa, whoa. Where did that come from?
Where did what come from?
I try to be supportive. And you break out
the hot lights and the rubber hose.
-I just asked what you've been working on.
-Oh, my God. Let it go.
-Do you believe this guy?
-I did it.
See, it's a-- It's a boat.
It's also a hat.
Okay, how do you wanna play this?
You want to pretend nothing's bothering you
and blow up later...
...or do you just wanna be a maniac right now?
Nothing is bothering me.
Fine. Be that way.
If you want to talk,
I'll be flushing my sinuses.
Wait.
I have a confession.
When I berated Leonard...
...it was a clever ruse to conceal the fact
that I'm not working on anything.
Well, I think I speak for everyone
when I say, ""No!""
The truth is,
I have nothing of interest to pursue.
Well, maybe this is the perfect opportunity
to take some time for yourself and refocus.
I'm sure you'll find something
you're excited about.
Thank you, Amy.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Hey. Can I stay here? Sheldon kicked me out.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, he just wants some alone time to work.
-Make yourself at home.
-We're just about to watch TV.
-You're welcome to join us.
-Thanks.
I'll be right with you.
I just have to do my Neti pot.
So, what are you guys gonna watch?
Okay. Hey, what do you think
we should open our show with?
""Thor and Dr. Jones""
or ""Let's Get Astrophysical""?
I think we should start with something
that gets them up on their feet.
Maybe ""Sherlock Around the Clock.""
Great. Yeah. Let's give it a try.

Halley's napping, keep it down!
Right, sorry.
It's cool. We don't need volume to rock.
Instead of blowing the roof off this place,

in the backyard.
Okay. One, two, three, four.

[PHONE RINGING]
Dang it.
Hello, Mother.
Hi there, Shelly.
You will never believe who I ran into
at the barbecue festival.
I am right in the middle
of some very important work.
I don't have time for this now.
Then why did you answer the phone?
Because you raised me to be polite.
Now stop bothering me.
Hello, again.
Who did you see at the barbecue festival?
Mr. Watkins.
You-- Really?
You called me and interrupted my work...
...to tell me you ran into somebody
you could plausibly run into?
I'm sorry, Mother, I really need to focus here.
I will speak to you next week.
Okay, sweetheart, I'll talk to you then.
[SIGHS]
I thought Mr. Watkins moved to Florida.
He did. He was back visiting his son.
Well, gosh darn it, that is interesting.
Was it Tommy or Joe? I bet it was Joe...
...because he and Tommy
had a falling out over that timeshare.
You guys do anything fun after dinner?
Actually, Amy came back over
and we hung out.
Did you know we're both
spelling bee champs?
We stayed up for hours
trying to stump each other.
Who won?
She thought she had me with ""appoggiatura""...
...but I shut that down expeditiously.
Heh, heh.
E-x-p-e-d-i-t-i-o-u-s-l-y. Expeditiously.
Wow, I bet that made Penny
take off all of her clothes.
Put her pajamas on and go to bed early.
-Yeah, like 9:00.
-Yeah.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Are we still on for band practice this evening?
-Oh, shoot.
I promised I would take Halley
over to Bernadette's parents.
-Dude, the gig's next weekend.
-I know.
I'm sorry. I really want to do this,
but I just don't think I have the time.
Okay. I guess I'll have to cancel.
Toby Greenbaum
will have to become a man without us.
Too bad. You guys kill at bar mitzvahs...
...and other events that people can't leave.
I don't want to be the one
who breaks up the band.
You know. Maybe you should think about
replacing me.
-Okay.
HOWARD: I mean....
-I know it will be hard since we--
-You know, I bet Bert could do it.
He plays guitar.
I'm gonna go ask him.
I guess he forgot that I play the cello.
I don't think he did.
-Okay, I think it's ready.
-Should we put on safety goggles?
Well, the funnest fun is the safest fun, so yes.
-Hey.
-Hello.
Oh, Amy, you're here. Again.
Sheldon needed another night to work,
so I said I'd give him some space.
So, what's all this?
Amy and I were talking about
old science fair projects...
-...and how fun it'd be to recreate them.
-We're making hot ice.
It's pretty cool.
-Nice one.
-Yeah.
Turns out we both did this
as our science fair projects in ninth grade.
Do you remember any of your
high school projects?
Well, I remember telling Jenny Runyan...
...I'd teach her how to flirt with boys
if she put my name on her project.
I got an A, she got pregnant.
Girls like you are why I had to come
straight home after school.
Check this out.
Look at that.
Wow, that's amazing.
Mm-hm. The crystallization is an exothermic
process, so the ice is actually hot.
-I won first place for this.
-So did I.
I threw Jenny's baby shower.
Hey, in seventh grade I built a cobra wave.
You wanna do that?
We can come up with
a wave speed formula...
...and see how accurately
we can predict the amplitude.
I didn't think anything could top last night's
spelling bee, but here comes math.
We don't have to do more experiments.
Let's do something we can all enjoy.
You wanna watch that show you like...
...where people want to buy a house
and then they do.
-No, do your experiments. I'll pick up dinner.
-Are you sure?
Yeah. You're having science fun
and I don't want to interfere.
Or watch you.
Did I actually do it?
I did. I did.
The answer is one in 18 million.
What is?
The odds of you running into Mr. Watkins.
Oh, Shelly, I have bad news.
Mr. Watkins passed this morning.
Oh.
Oh. I'm sorry.
I know. What are the odds of that?
Call you back.
LEONARD: Now let's calculate the amplitude.
AMY: All right.
Sheldon. Sheldon. Sheldon.
It's annoying when you do it.
-I brought pizza.
-Oh, thank you.
I have been working pretty hard.
I could use a break.
What's that?
Oh, that is an experiment...
...to see how many parallelograms I could draw
while holding my breath.
Is that where you blacked out?
No, actually, that's where I blacked out.
And this?
That is a list of all the different types
of natural disasters.
""Fire-quake""?
I made that one up.
I shouldn't have,
because now I'm scared of it.
-I thought you were working on actual science.
-I am.
I'm trying to come up with a new approach
to dark matter.
People keep distracting me.
First, my mother kept answering the phone
when I called...
...even though she knew I was busy.
And now you show up
with my favorite shape of food.
A circle made of triangles
served in a square box.
-Maybe I'll just eat this in the laundry room.
-No, no, wait.
You don't have to go, as long as you sit quietly
and don't say anything.
Fine.
-Mm. Good.
-Mm.
Are you mocking me?
Hey. Do you want to hear
one of my geology songs?
So it's about rocks?
Better. It's about a boulder.
Isn't that the same thing?
Far from it. A boulder has a diameter
greater than 25.6 centimeters.
Is that fact in the song?
No.
Yes.
It's sung from the viewpoint of the boulder
that chases Indiana Jones.
That is right up our alley. Let's hear it.

So I think if we want to predict
the height of the wave...
...we need to use elasticity theory...
...and model the lattice

This is fun. Playing with popsicle sticks...
...exploring ways to store kinetic energy.
-It's like preschool all over again.
-Heh, heh.
Except now if I eat paste it's because I want to,
not because Craig Schultz is making me.
-Can I ask you a question?
-Is it, ""Where was the teacher?""
She was in the bathroom smoking,
that's where.
It wasn't,
but I'm glad to see you've moved on.
I was gonna ask if being married
felt any different.
Oh. Um....
Not really.
Sorry, that probably wasn't the answer
you were looking for.
No, actually it is.
I mean, Sheldon and I
are in a really great place right now...
...and I don't want anything
to mess that up.
Mm-hm. You do remember you're here because
he kicked you out of your apartment?
Yes, his work is important to him.
It's one of the things I find
the sexiest about him.
-Well, that and...
-Ah....
-...his butt.
-Ah.
And then I was thinking about inventing
a new dark matter particle...
...to evade the omega baryon constraints.
But that just seems like something
anyone can come up with.
Agreed. Ahem.
You know what's blowing my mind?
Somebody thought about putting cheese
in this crust.
I just wish I could find something
that excites me.
You do understand that crust doesn't
normally come with cheese in it.
Okay. All right, look.
What got you excited
about dark matter in the first place?
Well, I left string theory,
which I'd been working on for a long time...
...and everyone was talking about
how cool dark matter was...
...and I thought, ""Sure, I'll give that a whirl.""
So it's your rebound science.
What's that?
Not the science
you spend the rest of your life with...
...but the one you use
to make yourself feel pretty again.
Well, if I'm being honest,
I never forgot about string theory.
It's remarkable. It's the closest we've come
to a theory of everything.
Something even Einstein couldn't figure out.
Well, if he couldn't figure it out,
maybe it's just wrong.
But it's so elegant.
I mean, look.
String theory posits that the fundamental
particles we see in three dimensions...
...are actually strings
embedded in multi-dimensional space-time.
Interesting.
So that would mean...
...that....
Can't do this by myself, buddy.
[KEYBOARD CLACKING]
What is happening?
I was trying not to wake you.
Did it work?
Sorry. I just realized....
Now that I'm not in the band,
I can focus on my own music.
You know? Go solo.
You said you were taking a break from the band
to help with me and the baby.
Yes. And write an astronaut musical.
Picture this: the curtain opens...
...there's a lone astronaut
floating in the inky blackness of space.
Maybe wires, maybe fog.
I'll let the director figure that out.
[SINGING]
I really don't know when
I'll run out of oxygen
Good news, I'm back in the band.
So Bernadette doesn't mind?
It was her idea.
So it's sort of like a guitar string...
...but instead of making an actual sound
each vibration is a different particle.
Precisely.
And when you express it in 11 dimensions...
...Einstein's relativity equations pop out.
Does that sound like a coincidence?
-It does not.
-Yeah.
That's what I think.
So did we do it?
Did we just solve string theory?
Oh, God.
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but this is not
the sort of thing we can figure out in a night.
People have been stuck on this for decades.
Decades? Really? It's a string.
How hard can it be?
It's straight, it's in a loop,
it gets knotted up with other strings.
Well, actually there are no knots
in anything greater than four dimensions.
Unless we get around that
by considering them as sheets.
You know, topologically speaking,
that has a lot of interesting possibilities.
See, how long did that take me, like a minute?
I thought you were getting us dinner.
Sorry, I had to stop at Sheldon's
and help him solve string theory.
What?
Yeah, turns out the answer's knots.
That's cute, but you can't have knots
in more than four dimensions.
Mm, you can if you consider them sheets.
Goodnight. Heh.
What up, my Hebrews and Shebrews?
We are Footprints on the Moon.
Toby, today you are a man
and you will face many obstacles in life.
And some of those obstacles
are gonna feel like boulders.

...and do you mind if I use your back room

Well, since it's you asking, I'm gonna

-The dinner thing. The

Yeah, but we're not doing anything big. She's 1,
Bernadette's on bed rest, and, ahem, I'm lazy.
-Hey, guys.
SHELDON: Hello.
-Howard.
-Raj.
Excuse me.
Really? Is this still happening?
I'm willing to make up,
but someone's being a baby.
Oh, I do love a riddle. Let me see.
My first guess would be Halley,
but that'd be strange...
...to accuse her of being a baby,
because she is a baby.
I suppose it could be Stuart.
His head does have a certain milky scent.
-Although--
-It's me, Sheldon. He's calling me a baby.
I don't know, I saw Leonard
put his keys in his mouth today.
You're a grown man. Act like it.

It was gonna be Howard's
but you can have it.
You two had a good run.
Who wants to go see
Last Jedi
again tonight?
-I'm in.
-Me too.
It'll be nice to see the parts
I missed while I was blinking.
Guys, there's a change of plans. We are
having a party for Halley's birthday after all.
Turns out Bernadette and
anyone who's not a heartless monster...
...thinks that's the right thing to do.
I don't like kids, but I do like birthday cake.
Oh, wait, will there be
sugary icing flowers on it?
I don't know.
I'll risk it.
But if I have a tantrum
and have to leave early, you'll know why.
Here you go. Here you go.
See you two there.
Are you kidding me? You're not gonna
invite me to Halley's birthday?
I'm her godfather. That means something.
Or-- Hear me out on this. --it doesn't.
Okay, that's enough. This fight either
has to end, or get way more entertaining.
Don't worry about it,
because I'm done putting up with him.
I know you have a lot on your mind...
...but when do you think we'll have an answer
on those cake flowers?
-Hey.
-Hey.
-What you reading?
-Yup, it's your brother's Christmas letter.
Ugh. If there's a picture of his wife,
and his kids, and his dogs, and his horses...
...all in matching pajamas,
I'd thank you to burn it.
Oh, the people's pajamas
have little horses on them...
...and the horses' have little people.
It's just his chance to brag
about how great his life is.
Come on, it's nice.
Know that nonprofit he works with?
They built a hospital in Rwanda.
Look at me. I built a hospital in Rwanda.
That's a good point.
I hadn't thought of it that way.
-Hello.
-Hey.
So this is for Amy's birthday.
Can I leave it here?
-Sure, what is it?
-Butter churn.
Oh, that's what I got her.
It's for her surprise frontier birthday dinner.
I am making hardtack, boiled salt pork...
...and because it's a special day,
a chewable gob of tree sap.
Is that good?
Compared to other foods, no.
Compared to other parts of a tree, um-eh.
And then after dinner,
we will have birthday coitus.
Do you think that will also
be historically accurate?
I assume, like the rest of frontier life,
it'll be exhausting and short. Heh.
You're exhausting and short.
Hey, Stuart. You're coming
to Halley's party, right?
You bet. Plus I live there, and I was invited.
So it's already better
than my 10th birthday party.
-Can you bring a few things?
-What do you need?
Balloons, streamers, ice, snacks,
a bounce house, face painter...
...and a couple kids whose parents
will lie and say they know me...
...from the Daddy and Me class
I've never been to.
-Where do you and Halley go every week?
-The important thing is we're together...
...and if the movie gets too violent,
I cover her eyes.
Don't stress about this party.
She's 1. She's not gonna remember.
The other day I showed her
her toe, and she was shocked.
It's not for the baby. It's for Bernadette.
She's feeling guilty about all the stuff
she's missing with Halley.
All right, Uncle Stuart's got your back.
Ain't no party like a Stuart party,
because Stuart's never invited to parties.
Did the electricity go out?
I don't know what you mean by ""electricity,""
ma'am. I am just a farmer boy...
...living in a little house on the prairie.
[SCREAMS]
I'm glad you're happy. I wanted to
do something special for your birthday.
You did, you did. It's perfect.
-You do know my birthday's tomorrow, right?
-This is just step one of your birthday weekend.
Now would you care to join me
for an authentic frontier dinner...
...made entirely from scratch?
-I can't believe you did this. It's amazing.
-Oh, it's not a big deal.
Just to be clear, it was a big deal.
-I was being modest. You got that, right?
-Loud and clear.
-Well, I hope you're hungry.
-Oh, I'm starving.
Oh, good. Starvation is authentic
to the time period.
If you also have malaria and a deep distrust
of Native Americans...
...we're really cooking with a wood stove.
-Is that butter?
-Yes, but don't blow it all on one biscuit.
It took me nine hours to make that.
I think I got churner's elbow.
I know we only have coitus on my birthday,
but I don't know if I can wait until midnight.
Well, you'll be glad you did.
Everyone knows the best foreplay
is rigid adherence to a strict schedule.
Hey, what are you doing?
I've decided to write
my own Christmas letter.
So I'm gonna make a list of
all the cool things we did this year.
Oh. Fun. Can I help?
Yes. Can you think of a single
cool thing we did this year?
Well, both of our jobs are going great.
Sure. I mean,
my Air Force project got taken away...
...and you're not crazy
about selling pharmaceuticals.
I'll just write down ""still employed.""
-Oh, we had our second anniversary.
-Yeah, but we did kind of forget about it.
So maybe just write ""still married.""
Okay, okay, that's a start.
What else?
You know, maybe this is enough.
Let's look at our pictures.
That'll jog our memories.
-What is that a picture of?
-That's a mole on my back.
I wanted to make sure it wasn't growing.
-How'd you get a picture of your own back?
-Sheldon took it. We're kind of mole buddies.
That's a cute picture. Isn't that the day
we almost went to the beach?
-Memorial Day?
-No, that was the day...
-...we almost went to the mountains.
-That's the great thing about California.
You can almost go to the mountains...
-...and almost go to the beach the same day.
-Yeah.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
I'm sorry about not inviting you
to Halley's birthday.
That wasn't cool, and of course,
we would love to have you. Here.
Thank you. I'd really like to be there.
Great, because it's tomorrow,
and I need you to plan it.
-What?
-Stuart was gonna help...
...but the free clinic had an open spot
for a colonoscopy, and he jumped on it.
Wait, so you're just apologizing
because you need something?
Yes, and I think it's
pretty mature of me to admit it.
-Well, that's very insulting.
-Right again. Are you gonna help me or not?
No, I will not help you.
But I will help Halley.
She's my goddaughter and I love her.
And I have a lot of party favors
left over from Cinnamon's birthday, so....
I hope she likes things
that squeak when you chew on them.
She's a human being, not an animal.
But that actually would be a hit.
Can I get you anything else?
No, thanks. I think I'm good.
You sure? There's still plenty of pork fat.
Although if we don't eat it,
I suppose we could turn it into soap.
That might taste better.
-I'll just go over here and sit on the couch.
-Oh, great.
Then we will move on to stage two,
the pitching of woo.
Ooh. Heh.
Should I read you some
bawdy 19th-century limericks?
Okay.
Oh, here.
There once was a priest from Terre Haute
Who purchased a sheep and a goat
Hold on a second.
Is it getting hot in here?
Well, I didn't even get to the dirty part yet.
I'm serious. Do you think there was
something wrong with that food?
Frontier scallops? I shouldn't think so.
-My stomach's feeling a little weird.
-Uh....
Mine too.
I'm sure it's just the first
sharp cramps of arousal.
No, this doesn't feel right.
Hey, save that sexy talk for the bedroom.
You know, if you'll excuse me,
I am just going to go freshen up.
[SHELDON VOMITTING]
-Sheldon?
-I'll be out in a minute.
I don't have a minute.
[VOMITTING]
I can't believe you pulled this
all together overnight.
If I had more time, I could've
gotten the Blue Man Group.
One of them goes to my dry cleaner,
who, by the way, hates him.
-You really saved the day.
-Well, it's not for you. It's for Halley.
And I'm sure she'd appreciate it,
if she knew what's going on, or who you are.
Morning.
Happy birthday.
Yeah, sure.
-Did you sleep at all?
-No. You?
I passed out on the toilet once.
I don't know if that counts.
-Feel any better?
-I feel terrible.
Well...
...should we make love now?
How can you even think about sex?
Hey, I'm a man.
I have annual needs, just like anyone.
And besides, it's our birthday tradition.
You think you can do it while
I lie perfectly still, and you don't touch me?
I can try.
[SHELDON SIGHS]
Wanna do it again?
-Morning.
-Morning.
""Kept Fern alive""? Who's Fern?
No, the fern. The one in the bathroom.
We're really calling
that brown thing alive? Okay.
So how long have you
been working on this?
A couple hours. I took a break
to try to beat my high score on
Mario Kart.
Well, did you do it?
Do you see it on the board?
Okay, this is silly. Our lives are great.
-I think so too.
-So then why is this bugging you so much?
Guess it feels like everyone's
moving forward, and we're stuck.
-What do you mean?
-Well, we've been married two years.
Should we think about what's next?
Like buying a house, or having a baby?
I wanna do all those things someday,
but there's stuff I wanna do first.
-Okay, like what?
-I don't know. Stay thin and have money.
No, no, I'm serious. If there's things
we wanna do, let's start doing them.
Okay, well, we've never been
on a big trip together.
-I would love that.
-There's something for your letter.
""Considered going on a trip.""
It's just a day trip, but we could
take the ferry out to Catalina.
Great, let's do it.
Amy's in the bathroom, and I need to-- Oh!
[DOOR SLAMS, THEN SHELDON VOMITS]
It's like I can hear the ocean already.
Okay, thanks for letting me know.
-Hey, what's going on?
-Bernadette's sister's kids are sick...
...and they're not coming.
But they're the whole reason
the cupcakes are vegan.
BERNADETTE: How's the party coming?
-Good.
Great. Our friends
should be here any second.
Those are the only
other people you invited?
What about the kids
from the Daddy and Me class?
Oh, grow up.
SHELDON:
Uh-oh.
-What?
-I left the food out.
You afraid it's gonna go good?
How are you feeling?
Ugh. My stomach aches. I've got the chills.
My mouth tastes weird.
It hurts to swallow,
and I've got a little double vision.
Yeah.
I'm feeling better too.
[SHELDON GROANS]
-Well, this party's a disaster.
-Don't blame the party.
You know how many favors I had to call in with
my bounce-house guy to get Wonder Woman?
Is that Wonder Woman?
Technically, it's a Chinese knockoff
called Happy Strong Swimsuit Lady.
Then I take it back. It's a great party.
You can sit here and sulk if you want.
I'm gonna go celebrate Halley's first birthday.
Which I planned with no help from you.
What are you doing?
It's a bounce house.
I'm gonna go bounce in it.
You're supposed to take your shoes off
before you go in there.
You know what? I'm stressed about
my daughter's birthday party.
I don't need your attitude.
Well, I worked really hard on this,
and you haven't even said ""thank you.""
I'm sorry. Thank you for blaming me
for everything that's wrong in your life.
Thank you for walking out on our friendship.
You are welcome. And thank you
for mocking me for all these years.
Thank you for making it so easy!
Why are you being such a jerk?
Because you're my best friend
and you hurt my feelings.
Well, you're my best friend
and you hurt my feelings.
I can't believe you shoved me.
I can't believe you shoved me.
But it was kind of fun, wasn't it?!
-It was. Do it again!
-Gladly!
Okay, now at the same time!
RAJ:
Ho-ho.
-That was awesome.
-Yeah, okay. This time, knees, then feet.
One, two, three.
RAJ:
Again, again!
-Hello.
AMY: Hi.
HOWARD: You made it.
-How are you two feeling?
A little better.
Those books should've been called
The Little Outhouse on the Prairie.
BERNADETTE: Halley's awake, ready for party.
-Be right up.
PENNY: I wanna see the birthday girl.
RAJ: I'd love to see her.
BERNADETTE: Walk slow. It takes a while
to get this bra back on.
You know...
-...it's still your birthday.
-It is.
And we are both feeling better.
We are.
-And there's no one in that bounce house.
-No.
Great.
Let's go jump for a bit,
and then find a bedroom to have coitus in."
s11ep10.xml,"This was a good idea, it's been a long time
since we've had girls' night.
So nice to have a relaxing evening
at home doing nothing.
Yeah, really breaks up the other 30 days
I've spent on bed rest doing nothing.
Well, tonight we're gonna make you
forget all that.
Gonna make me forget I've been stuck in bed
while a baby uses my bladder as a kickball?
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Hey, you had unprotected sex with Howard.
You deserve to be miserable.
Hey, I need some fashion advice.
Really, from me? I'd love--
Actually, Leonard told me
Penny was here.
-Hey, what's going on, you got a date?
-I do have a date, with science.
What's science wearing?
The Griffith Observatory
is looking for an astrophysicist to consult.
-I have an interview tomorrow.
-I love the Observatory.
They tell you your weight
on all the different planets.
It's always bikini season on Venus.
I think you'd be great at that.
Don't you, Bernadette?
Huh? I'm listening, I'm listening.
I'm not watching
The Crown.
I want to make a good impression and thought
you could help me pick out an outfit.
Of course. Let's see what you've got.
You just need to pick something
that you feel confident in.
Sorry,
I left my magic clothes at home.
I'm sure these two options will be--
So you have other clothes at home?
It doesn't matter, they're talking
to a bunch of people, I probably won't get it.
-Don't say that.
-You have to believe in yourself.
Before I came to America,
I was filled with confidence.
-What happened to me?
-Hey, is that Raj there at girls' night?
Oh, hey. Hey, Howard.
Just remember, if you fall asleep first,
they're gonna freeze your bra.
You and Amy having fun
planning your wedding?
We're employing a mathematical approach
called decision theory, so heck yeah.
""Heck yeah""? Looks like someone needs
to put a dollar in the ""almost swear"" jar.
We've assigned all wedding decisions randomly
and each of us makes half of them:
From venue to officiant to numbering system
for the tables, Roman or Dewey Decimal.
Why not hexadecimal?
This is our wedding, not a joke.
-Hey, guys.
SHELDON: Hello.
Oh, good, Raj is here
to tell us today's specials.
Very funny.
I have my interview this afternoon.
If it doesn't work out, you're ready
to go on your Mormon mission.
I don't understand
what's going on here.
What's going on is I'm up for a job at the
planetarium and Howard is making fun of me.
That's great,
you're both doing what you love.
-Well, I'm excited for you.
-Oh, thanks.
I'd be in charge of developing
and narrating the planetarium shows.
I really want this. It wouldn't kill you
to be more supportive.
But if it did, you could bury me
at the funeral home you direct.
So wait, the premise
is that he is dressed differently?
Yeah.
[LAUGHS]
That's true, he is not dressed the same.
[SKYPE TONES SOUND]
-Hey, Dad.
-Hello, Rajesh.
How was the interview?
Not so great. They asked me what my
biggest weakness was and 45 minutes later...
...they thanked me for coming.
Son, don't take this the wrong way,
but what's your problem?
I would tell you,
but apparently it takes 45 minutes.
You know what? I bet it's those friends
you surround yourself with.
Like that Howard, always making fun of you.
Howard doesn't mean anything by it,
I think it's cultural.
His people come from a very sarcastic village
called Brooklyn.
Don't make excuses.
What kind of friend acts that way?
-Well, I guess--
-It was a rhetorical question. A bad friend.
Come on, Dad,
that's just our relationship, okay?
He makes Indian jokes, I laugh, but, you know,
with angry eyes so he knows it's not okay.
I, too, was in a relationship with someone
who made me feel bad about myself.
If you're talking about Mom,
I don't want to hear it.
I'm just saying if you replace Howard
with a nice 22-year-old grad student...
...your self-confidence will soar.
All right, Amy, you're up.
Next decision.
Come on, first dance, come on, first dance.
-Invitations. That's a good one.
-Oh! Ha-ha.
Just a suggestion,
hologram projected out of R2-D2.
Thanks for your input, but this is my decision
and I'm gonna go with....
Old English calligraphy on Egyptian papyrus.
What a fun mashup.
It's like the chicken and waffles
of orthography.
Your turn.
Ring bearer!
Boy, I am so glad that R2-D2 is still available.
You know, this is really fun.
I can't believe people say planning a wedding
is one of the most stressful things in life.
I know. Not a day goes by that I don't marvel
how much better we are than other people.
-So sorry the interview didn't go well.
-You would've been perfect for it.
I just get so nervous and then
I start apologizing for being nervous....
-You don't want to hear this, I'm sorry.
-Stop apologizing.
Oh, my God, you sound
like the woman at the interview.
Have you ever thought about
talking to a therapist about all this?
Ugh. Maybe. Leonard, do you think your mom
would be available?
Yeah, you don't want to do that.
Talking to my mom to get more confidence
is like talking to a lion to get more alive.
My dad thinks it's because Howard's
always making fun of me.
That makes sense.
-What do you mean, that makes sense?
-Howard does make fun of him a lot.
That's not all Howard's fault.
If Raj doesn't wanna be made fun of, then I....
Hmm. I don't know a nice way
to finish this sentence.
-You're on his side?
-I'm just saying, this is what friends do.
They bust on each other,
it doesn't mean anything.
-Not surprised you think so.
-Why is that?
-Well, you can be kind of mean to me.
-Well, that's because you're....
Wow. I don't know how to finish
that sentence either.
You know what?
I think we're both done being disrespected.
-I've got a few rounds left in me.
-Attaboy, champ.
Okay, let's see what we've got so far.
I arrive in a
Little House on the Prairie
style
horse-drawn buggy....
Where you are met
with an honor guard of Stormtroopers....
Do you think that might be jarring, going
from wholesome pioneers to space Nazis?
I see what you're saying.
You're thinking you should arrive
in a replica of Luke Skywalker's landspeeder.
It's not what I'm thinking.
And to save you the trouble for the future,
it will never be what I'm thinking.
Well, if the ushers are so important to you,
what if I propose a trade?
You may pick that,
and I will decide, say, first dance.
Great, then the ushers will be my cousins
dressed in frontier frock coats.
And the first dance will be
that we won't have one.
All right, then our second dance
will be the first dance.
Unless we have no dance at all. Ha, ha.
Well, if we're changing things,
then instead of throwing confetti...
...we'll release butterflies.
Airborne worms? Have you lost your mind?
If you're going to do that,
then I'm changing the officiant...
...to that husky Spider-Man
that hangs out at the Chinese Theatre.
Fine, wedding toasts in Latin.
Great, vows in Klingon.
Then I'm changing the flower girl to a dog.
Guess what he'll be scattering
instead of petals.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Wanna grab some lunch?
You know what? I don't think so.
Let me guess, you're not eating...
...because the mean girls
circled your chubby bits in marker?
No, that, that right there. That's the reason.
You're always making fun of me.
Those are just jokes,
it's my way of saying that we're friends...
...and it wouldn't hurt you to drop a few.
See?
No wonder I don't have any confidence.
-Come on, you can't blame that on me.
-Why not?
Fifteen years of constant ridicule.
I think our relationship has become toxic.
What are you saying?
I think you and I need to spend
some time away from each other.
Look, I can see you're upset,
but I'm gonna need some ground rules.
While we're apart,
can I see other needy Indian men?
Get out!
What do you think will make
the wedding worse for Amy:
A cake made with salt instead of sugar...
...or a cake iced with congealed gravy?
That is a trick question.
The answer is you as the groom.
Neither one will be the actual cake.
I'm just using it as a bargaining chip...
...to get Amy to agree
to the whole wedding party getting rings...
...and us getting one ring to rule them all.
I forget, which mental hospital
are you guys registered at?
-Hello.
-Hello.
Really? You're not gonna sit here?
I'll sit there as soon as you leave.
You're still on this? I said sorry.
""Sorry"" doesn't make up
for years of emotional abuse.
What's it gonna take?
You want half my sandwich?
What's going on?
Raj is trying to blame me
for his pathetic life.
His life isn't pathetic,
he's got that whole table to himself.
One of us should go sit with Raj
so he's not alone.
I'm not done telling you
about my wedding revenge plans.
You're right, go on.
First, I'm going to try to get Amy
to trade with me for hors d'oeuvres....
Oh, good, you're here.
I've decided on our centerpieces.
I just hope your family
isn't allergic to asbestos.
Sheldon, please stop.
If we keep doing this, we're gonna end up
with a wedding neither one of us will enjoy.
-Are you saying you don't want to get married?
-No, of course I do.
That seems to be the one thing
we can agree on.
Maybe we should just get married at city hall
and forget about everything else.
City hall? Hmm.
I do like metal detectors...
...and the sound of permits being denied.
Right, and if we're not enjoying planning
this wedding, then what's the point?
Historically, a wedding was to let other
potential suitors know we're unavailable...
...but I think matching T-shirts
that say ""hands off the merchandise""...
...accomplish the same thing.
So let's pick a day and just go do it.
How about tomorrow?
Really? That soon?
Why wait? I mean,
it's not that I think we're living in sin...
...but I do like the idea that our next act
of intimacy would be a legal requirement.
Tomorrow we'll go downtown
and get married.
Or we could go to Beverly Hills city hall
if you want a destination wedding.
Hey. You look good today.
What happened? What's wrong?
Just tell me, I can take it.
Nothing. I felt bad about being mean to you,
so I'm being nice.
Oh, okay. Sorry, I wasn't ready for it.
Try again.
-You look handsome.
-Nope, still freaking me out.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
-Hello, friends.
PENNY & LEONARD: Hey.
-What's going on with your hair?
-Nothing, I just decided to stop straightening it.
Wait, so you were making your hair
look like that on purpose?
When I first moved to America,
I wanted to fit in, Howard's hair was straight...
-...and he was the coolest person I knew.
-Then you never saw any other people?
I don't wanna talk about Howard.
I came here to celebrate.
I went back to the planetarium and told them
they were making a huge mistake...
...that I'd be perfect for the job. I was charming,
I was confident and they gave it to me.
-That's amazing.
-Yeah. Plus, it turns out...
...the guy they hired got busted
at a sketchy massage parlor.
So happy ending for you-- Oh, and for him.
I was on my way to tell Howard and then
I remembered I'm not speaking to him...
-...so I came here.
-Don't you think it's time you two made up?
No, no, actually, I don't need
his negative energy in my life right now.
Standing up to him was hard
but it made me realize that I can do anything...
...and yeah, it's a little sad but,
you know, life is all about--
[CORK POPS]
Sorry,
I thought you were wrapping things up.
-Hey, Howard.
-Hey.
-Where is everybody?
-I could ask you the same question.
Wow, this conversation got mean, fast.
Sorry, I'm just in a bad mood.
What's going on?
I had a falling out with Raj.
He said I make fun of him too much
and it's wrecked his confidence.
Please,
confidence is like red blood cells...
...it's nice if you got some,
but you don't need them.
Yeah, your life's a mess...
...I don't see you blaming other people for it.
That's right, I grew up in a loving,
supportive household.
This is all on me.
Maybe I'll just hang out here for a while.
-Great. You can make fun of me all you want.
-No, that's okay.
No, no, no, go on, I can take it. My feelings,
like my extremities, are basically numb.
Here's your license. If you wait there,
we'll call you when the officiant's ready.
-Do we need a blood test?
-No.
Then how will you know
whether or not we have syphilis?
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say you don't have that.
You officially exceeded
the number of times...
...I hoped to hear the word ""syphilis""
on my wedding day.
I can't believe we're doing this.
I'm getting married,
the new
Star Wars
movie's coming out.
We are really finishing this year strong.
Okay, but of the two of those--
You know, I'm not even gonna ask.
Are you sad we're not having a big party?
I'm really not.
I'm here with you, it's perfect.
Cooper-Fowler, you're up.
Oh.
Can you believe it?
We're about to walk in that door
Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fowler...
...and walk out as a married couple,
Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fowler.
Wait.
I wanna have a first dance with you.
-Right here?
-At our wedding.
This is our wedding.
No.
I want a real wedding.
-Sheldon, it was just making us fight.
-I know.
But, Amy, I never thought
I would want to marry anyone...
...so the fact that I found you is astonishing.
It's like finding dark matter...
...except they're looking for dark matter,
I wasn't even looking for you.
So you're even better than dark matter.
-Sheldon.
-Plus, you interact with light so I can see you.
Also, you don't account
for the missing mass in the universe.
Oh, and--
You're getting caught up
on the ways I'm not like dark matter.
Right, sorry.
But when you make a discovery like this...
...you don't just take it down to city hall,
you tell the whole world.
And I'll say it in Latin or Klingon...
...or smoke signals,
if that's not cultural appropriation.
-It is.
-Okay, so not smoke signals.
But I want to do this right.
Me too.
Let's go plan a wedding.
You know, we did get dressed up
and come all the way to city hall.
What are you thinking?
I have always wanted a permit
to dispose of hazardous waste.
Let's do it.
Do we know if there's life
in the methane plumes of Enceladus...
...or under the icy surface of Europa?
Come back on Tuesday
for my next show to find out.
Spoiler alert: We don't.
I'm Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,
and thank you for taking a walk with me...
...through the stars.
Wow, I never knew science
could be so interesting.
-Hey, I talk to you about science all the time.
-Oh, you sure do, sweetie.
Should we go congratulate him?
I'll do better than that,
I'll give him constructive criticism.
Here's some constructive criticism: Don't.
-I'll catch up with you guys.
-Okay.
-Raj, you were terrific.
-Thank you.
I was so nervous,
my armpits are like a swamp.
Your hug just got downgraded
to a high-five.
Ha-ha. And your palms are sweaty too.
Hey, what are you doing
all the way in the back?
Hiding out. I wasn't sure if I was welcome.
This is ridiculous, you guys are best friends.
Of course he wants you here.
You sure?
He seems to be doing pretty well without me.
Look, he was just stressed out,
his life is not better without you.
Come say hi.
Okay.
Dr. Koothrappali, I just wanted
to tell you that was amazing.
-A counterpoint--
-To the car.
-Can I ask you a question?
-Of course you can.
That went well, ask me another.
I think I'm just gonna go.
If there is life beneath the surface
of these planets, how would we even detect it?
That's a complicated question.
Let me start with a simpler one,
can I buy you a coffee?
Also a complicated question. Heh-heh.
I want to say yes, but if I drink coffee
this late, I'll be up all night.
Decaf, genius. Ahem.
I would love to."
s11ep14.xml,"Space is the mirror of the soul.
Are we looking beyond
or are we looking within?
I'm looking at my shoes.
This is making me a little motion sick.
When we gaze out at the immensities
of space, we understand them...
...because there are immensities
within us as well.
I'm Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,
and thank you for taking a walk with me...
...through the stars.
That pause gets longer every show.
I believe... you're right.
-Hey, can I get a picture with you?
-Absolutely.
And if you post it on social media,
I suggest the hashtag ""Koothra-poet.""
Heh, heh, heh. The show was great.
I can't take all the credit,
I have pretty good co-stars...
...the stars. Heh, heh.
-Do you say that to everyone?
-Only to beautiful women.
-And okay women.
-Okay.
Just to clarify, you're the first kind.
Okay.
Thanks for coming. What did you
handsome gentlemen think of the show?
You can turn it off now.
Sweet of you to say, but...
...I don't think I can.
Look at this cute picture
of Halley in the bath.
-Oh, that's great.
-Want me to send it to you?
No. On your phone, it's cute.
On my phone, it's a crime.
I also have a pretty cute picture to share.
HOWARD:
What is that?
An equation.
Isn't it perfect?
Sometimes I stare at it and think,
""I can't believe that came out of me.""
Well, since we're sharing pictures,
I have one to contribute.
Please don't let it be
you and your dog in the bathtub.
It's not.
But don't swipe.
What are we looking at here?
That's me and a beautiful woman...
...and my watch showing the time
as 2:30 in the morning.
-So, State's Exhibit A?
LEONARD: Heh, heh, heh.
No, I met her at the planetarium
a few days ago...
...and she invited me out for a drink.
Good for you.
What's the Hindi word for dog?
-A
Kutta.
-You
kutta.
Heh, heh.
[BARKING]
That's Hindi for ""woof-woof.""
I am seeing her again tonight.
I also have a date tonight.
But don't worry, it's not another woman,
it's string theory.
[BARKING]
Sorry. He's a
kutta,
you're not.
-Hi.
-Hello.
What you doing?
-Oh, taking another picture with my baby.
-[CAMERA CLICKS]
Look how big he got.
It's fun to see you this excited.
Thank you, that's--
Don't sit there!
What, what, what?
Sorry, that's part of my organization system.
That's where those papers go.
Okay.
-How about if I just slide this notebook over--
-Eeh!
It's fine. I'll be in the bedroom.
No, no. This is your apartment too.
I'll stop for the night and clean this up.
Well, that's very considerate, Sheldon.
I know.
See, I'm trying this new technique...
...where I imagine how I would feel
in someone else's position.
You mean empathy?
Oh, I thought I came up with it.
Well, regardless, I appreciate the effort.
Thank you. It's really hard.
-Morning.
-Good morning.
You didn't have to cook me breakfast.
Well, I wasn't sure how I did last night,
and I wanted to finish strong.
You don't need to worry,
last night was great.
Well, you say that now...
...but wait until you've taste this.
Oh, my God, this is amazing.
Which is why I keep
an omelet pan in my car.
[BOTH LAUGH]
Well, thank you. It's delicious.
My husband never cooked for me.
Oh, you were married?
Yeah. Well, technically, I guess I still am.
Is that ""technically,"" like the paperwork
hasn't gone through or...
...""technically,"" like, he's in the closet
watching us right now?
No, no, no. We're separated.
-You mind if we talk about something else?
-Of course.
You know my secret
to making great omelets...
...is that I beat the egg whites separately.
Speaking of which,
how long have you been separated?
About two weeks.
That is not a lot of weeks.
In fact, that's the bare minimum
to get to the plural ""weeks.""
Doesn't matter. He moved out, I moved on.
Oh, good. You mind me asking
what he does for a living?
-He's a firefighter.
-Oh. Interesting.
A potentially jealous man
who's handy with an ax.
Heh, heh. It's-- It's okay, though.
He's almost had two weeks to cool down.
Okay, the next drug is Romatrol.
Oh, I know this one.
We're pushing it really hard.
It treats mild dermatitis.
Correct.
And who can it be prescribed to?
Adults and children who have
absolutely, for sure, stopped growing.
Right again.
And what are the side effects?
Oh, shoot, shoot.
Remember the mnemonic.
Gravy, yes. G-R-A-V-Y.
Okay. Gastric distress, redness,
anal leakage, vasculitis and...
...yellow eyes.
Oh, it's so close.
-It's actually yellow discharge.
-Oh, right.
That's why we went with gravy.
-Hello.
-Hi.
He knows he doesn't
live here anymore, right?
Maybe he's experiencing memory loss
because he took...?
-Fluoxetrite!
-Yeah!
SHELDON: Thank you.
LEONARD: Sheldon, what are you doing?
Oh, I was checking on my old room
to see what you've done with it.
-Why?
-I could use a place to work in the evening--
-No.
-It's just there's not a lot of space in our--
-No.
-I feel like Amy's been--
-No.
-And since you're not doing--
No.
-It's--
-No!
No.
That is our room now,
and we're gonna turn it into a gym.
You expect me to believe that?
-No.
-No.
So I guess what's bugging me
is they only broke up 13 days ago...
...and now I'm dating her.
So, am I like the good guy in my movie
or the bad guy in their movie?
Pretty sure you're the weird friend
in our movie.
I like her, okay?
I don't know how I feel about
being a third wheel in a relationship.
Says the guy in my bed with my wife.
Guys, I mean, he's around, okay?
He's apparently not happy
about the breakup.
And based on the sweat pants he left,
he's a medium-to-large man.
Maybe those are his after-the-holiday pants,
like you have.
Oh, no. Do you think it's too soon
for her to be dating?
If you and Bernadette broke up,
how long would you wait?
-I don't want to think--
-Eight days.
-What?
-Two days to cry.
Six days to hit the gym.
First of all, you already look amazing.
Aw, that's sweet.
I'm gonna give him an extra day of crying.
The answer is still no.
You can say we wouldn't know
you're here, but we'd know.
Because you'd be here!
So who was that?
I can't believe you hung up on me.
What the hell?
What are you doing here?
I am proving you wrong.
I've been back there for hours.
You had no idea.
Ugh. Do something.
What the hell?
What are you doing here?
I am trying to respect Amy.
You have an office at work,
why don't you go there?
I can't go to the office
every time I have a thought.
-I'd basically be living there.
-Sounds good, do that.
No, no. The campus isn't safe at night.
There's raccoons and undergraduates
walking around like they own the place.
Look, I need somewhere to work
in the evenings.
You have a space you aren't using.
Just take a look at my proposal.
-Ugh. What is this?
-A rental agreement.
I will only use the room for work.
I won't sleep here, eat your food,
I won't use your bathroom.
So you can just walk in any time
of the day or night?
He does that now.
At least this way we'll get paid.
I'm Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali...
...and thank you for taking a walk with me...
...through the stars.
I think that one was too long.
Yeah, you're right, I totally felt it.
-Should we run it again?
-Please, God, no.
-Hey.
-Can I help you?
Which one of you is Rajesh Koothrappali?
Really, you're not sure which one of us
is Rajesh Koothrappali?
I am. I was just trying not to be racist.
I'm Nell's husband.
Oh, uh-- Here's the thing,
I didn't know that she was married until after.
After what?
-I'm really sorry.
-Well, that doesn't make me feel better.
-What would make you feel better?
-I want you to stop seeing my wife.
Done. Nice to meet you. Bye.
What am I gonna do?
[SOBBING]
Hey. Buddy, do you wanna talk?
I thought we were gonna start a family.
Next thing I know, it's over.
[SOBS]
It's gonna be okay.
How's it gonna be okay?
You're sleeping with my wife.
I mean, besides that.
Can I get you anything?
A glass of water, a laser show?
-No, thank you.
-Good, because I don't know how to turn it on.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come here.
I guess I just wanted to see
who she replaced me with.
Don't say that. What you two had was special.
No one can replace you.
-Did she say that?
-No.
-I should go, right?
-Stay.
Okay, I'll call you later.
Look, if it makes you feel better,
I barely know her.
And she had sex with you?
Nell tells me you're a fireman.
What's that like?
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]
Okay, I'm really uncomfortable
with him back in that room.
Why? He hasn't made a peep all day.
You don't get it. All the years
that we lived together, he drove me crazy.
And now he's not.
Exactly.
Look, don't look at me like that.
It means he did it on purpose.
It was a choice.
That's like finding out Godzilla
could've had Arby's instead of Tokyo.
-I don't think they have Arby's in Japan.
-Not my point.
Sheldon. Sheldon.
I'm sorry, am I being too loud?
No, you're being perfect and you know it.
Would you like me to be
a less considerate tenant?
No. Yes. What--? Stop messing with me!
Hey, I was wrong.
There's an Arby's in Okinawa.
He was best friends with her older brother,
but he didn't even notice her...
...and then years later they randomly
bumped into each other at the DMV.
Two hours later, they were in love. You can
really see the sparkle in his license photo.
-He told you this at the planetarium?
-No, we went to House of Pies.
He got banana cream,
I got coconut, we did halfsies.
You did pie halfsies with another man?
You mean other than you?
Yeah.
I feel bad for him, Bernie.
He's a good guy.
If you're uncomfortable,
stop sleeping with his wife.
I don't think the sex is the problem,
I know for a fact I was just okay.
For the record,
I introduced you to House of Pies.
Sheld-- Oh, Leonard.
-Sorry, I had to get out of there.
-What did he do now?
Nothing, he's being a dream.
Don't give me that look,
that's how Penny looked at me. I'm not crazy.
Penny and I have the same ""you're crazy"" look?
That's kind of sweet.
I know how to deal
with Sheldon being Sheldon...
...but Sheldon being a rational,
thoughtful person? I'm clueless.
It's like when my mom called last year
to sing ""Happy Birthday"" and I just threw up.
If it gets to be too much,
you can always send him back here.
I made a deal with him,
and besides, it wouldn't be fair to you.
-I miss him, he's been over there a lot.
-Great, tell him he can come back.
I can't, he's thinking of me and my feelings
and trying to be respectful.
That's what he's doing to me, too,
the jerk!
Stop that.
Your mad look
and Sheldon's constipated look are the same.
-This is nice.
-It is.
She used to kiss me like that.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.
Oh, God, I'm so alone.
-Sorry, I can't do this.
-What's going on?
I met Oliver the other day.
Wait, you tracked down my husband?
No, that would be weird. He tracked me down,
then we spent the evening together.
I don't believed this.
He only did it because he cares about you.
No, he did it
because he's possessive and jealous.
I didn't get that at all.
He made me feel very comfortable.
Well, I'm glad you two hit it off.
You know,
I don't think you're being very fair to him.
You're taking his side?
No. I should point out
that he offered to go to counseling...
...so at least one of you is trying.
-You're crazier than he is.
-I'll tell you what.
Give him one more chance,
and if it doesn't work out...
...I'll be happy to keep sleeping with you.
You would?
Either way, you've got yourself a fella,
how nice is that?
Hey, Sheldon.
-Hello.
-Hey.
So your contract provides
for a three-day trial period...
...and I don't think this is working out.
So to put it in legal terms,
the party of the first part...
...would like the party of the second part
to get out.
-What time does the trial period end?
-Twelve noon.
And what does it say after that?
Eastern Standard Time.
That was three hours ago.
And since you didn't exercise
your right to revoke...
...I exercised my right to extend...
...triggering this long-form
rental agreement...
...of which you're already in violation.
This is just a bunch of paper.
You can't enforce this.
Hire a lawyer. Let's find out.
-This is not happening.
-Be that as it may...
...page nine says you have to provide me...
...with lemon-flavored sparkling water,
so chop-chop.
-How'd it go?
-Apparently he's not leaving...
...and I have to go get him sparkling water.
Why are you smiling?
I don't know, it just feels right.
Through the stars.
-Hey.
-Hey, buddy.
I talked to Nell.
She was pretty upset after you left.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
No, no, no. She told me
that you said something so creepy...
...that I seemed great in comparison.
I know exactly what it was.
There was a couple things it could've been.
Whichever one it was, it was creepy.
Anyway, I went over to comfort her
and we talked...
...and I think we're gonna give it
another chance.
-I'm so happy for you.
-Hey, hey.
-Hey, we should celebrate.
-House of Pies?
-You know it.
-Heh, heh.
-Should we invite Nell?
-Do we have to?
OLIVER:
No."
s11ep15.xml,"NARRATOR:
Previously on the
Big Bang Theory:
-Leonard, tell everyone your news.
Oh, I am starting a book.
That would be big news from Penny,
but you've read a book before.
He means he's writing a book.
I do. It's something I've been thinking about
for a long time.
Yeah, it's about a brilliant physicist
who solves crimes using science.
-Oh, Leonard--
-It's not about you.
-Oh, boy.
-What?
They cast the new Professor Proton.
-Is it Sheldon?
-Not exactly.
SHELDON:
Wheaton!
It's Wil Wheaton.
What are you doing? I thought we were
having dinner at Leonard and Penny's.
Oh, no, they're watching
the new
Professor Proton.
I can't keep Wil Wheaton off the Internet
but I can keep him off my retinas.
You're gonna sit here by yourself
and do nothing?
Of course not.
I'm going to write mean comments
about Wil's show online.
You can't criticize something
you haven't seen.
I'm sorry, are you familiar with the Internet?
What if I watch it with you?
Maybe I won't like it
and we can complain about it together.
Get your own thing to complain about.
Oh, trust me, I've got one.
Look, at least if you watch it...
...maybe you'll find
more specific things to criticize.
Oh, that is a good point.
Criticisms are more hurtful
when they're specific.
MAN [SINGING]:
Grab your goggles
Lab coat on
Here he comes
Professor Proton
Hey, everybody. I'm Professor Proton.
Welcome to the show.
Today I'll be teaching you
how to make a real hovercraft...
...using common household items.
Darn it, I do like objects that hover.
All you will need is a CD, a bottle cap,
a balloon, and some super glue.
Oh, no, I have all those things.
[TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING]
-Hey.
-Hi.
[BELL DINGS]
-What is that noise?
-Oh, it's my new keyboard.
It looks and sounds
like an old-fashioned typewriter.
Makes me feel like a real novelist.
You poured yourself a scotch.
-Apple juice.
-Oh.
But unsweetened
like Hemingway used to drink.
-So how's the book coming along?
-Good.
I wrote the part where the hero,
hot-shot physicist, Logan Dean...
-...arrives at CERN.
-Oh, is he based on you?
Kind of, but he can eat dairy products
without having to leave the room.
That's smart, because CERN is in Switzerland
and there's a lot of cheese there.
Believe me, that is a plot point later.
-I'm excited to read it whenever you're ready.
-Thank you.
-Oh, I just thought of the murder weapon.
-Swiss Army Knife?
Heh-heh. No.
[CHUCKLES]
That's way better.
Look, it works. We did it.
See? There was a reason
to keep that Turbo Tax CD.
CD ROM? More like CD-vroom.
Do you feel bad you told Wil Wheaton
that you'd be his enemy if he did this show?
No. I feel bad I'm engaged to somebody
that would point that out.
It's time for Professor Proton's
science joke of the day.
Why can you not trust atoms?
SHELDON:
Hmm.
Because they make up everything.
Ha-ha. That's funny.
Because they do, they make up everything.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
I wonder who that could be.
Just when I thought
this couldn't get any better...
...Wil has introduced suspense into the show.
Hey, it's real NASA astronaut, Howard Wolowitz.
What?
-Hey, Professor Proton.
-Hey, thanks for being here.
No problem, I'm on my launch break.
How could Wil ask Howard
to be on his show and not me?
Well, he is an astronaut...
...and he didn't start an online petition
to get Wil fired.
Why wouldn't Howard tell me?
Well, because he probably worried
you'd be a big baby about it.
All those answers make a lot of sense.
Thank you, Amy, that helps.
And then, when the lights come back on
in the supercollider room...
...Dr. Logan Dean
makes two important discoveries:
A gluino and murder.
Oh. Gluino, that's exciting.
[GRUFFLY]
And murder.
[GRUFFLY]
I heard you.
The first time.
I don't know which Hemsworth is playing
Logan Dean, but I know it's a Hemsworth.
-Logan is actually based on me.
-So a young Paul Giamatti.
I have to finish writing it
before they make it a movie.
-I still have a few things to figure out.
-You should talk to Bernadette.
Since she's been on bed rest, she's binged
like every detective show in the world.
Oh, there was a funny detective show
in India called
Karamchand.
He had an assistant named Kitty
and he was always saying, ""Shut up, Kitty.""
It sounds less mean if you say it in Hindi...
...and don't think of women as having feelings.
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Howard, I want you to know that I forgive you.
-I'll take it.
What's he forgiving you for?
Don't care, clean slate.
Happy Yom Kippur to me.
I know you were on Wil's show
and I know why you didn't tell me.
Do you?
You were afraid I'd be difficult
and annoying about it.
I hope your book has a twist
as surprising as that.
It doesn't.
-I thought you were boycotting Wil's show.
-I was...
...but I decided to give it a shot
and actually enjoyed it.
Just out of curiosity,
how did you come to be on the show?
Did he ask you? Did you ask him?
Did you just show up on the set
and ring that doorbell?
Sheldon, if you wanna be on the show,
you're gonna have to apologize to Wil.
That would be the mature thing to do.
Let's put a pin in that and keep thinking.
-Ooh.
-What? Which part?
-That was just the baby kicking.
-Got it. Heh.
-But this is good so far, really good.
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I have no idea who the killer is.
-Great, me neither.
Does Penny know
you based a character on her?
What character?
-Ilsa, the head of the institute. That's Penny.
-No, it's not.
Really? Confident, ball-busting beauty
who's always rolling her eyes at Logan?
Trust me, that describes more women
than you think.
""He looked at the stunning woman
who was his boss and said....""
It's murder.
Figure that out yourself, genius?
-Okay, no need to be snarky.
-Who would want to kill him?
Could be anyone.
Dr. Silvers.
Dr. Prekash.
Hans the janitor.
But the door's locked
so it has to be someone in this room.
Wow, you are on fire.
Maybe it is a little like Penny.
Any chance she'll be flattered?
I don't know, she's pretty mean.
-Ilsa or Penny?
-Exactly.
-Hey, Howard, what's up?
-I'm so sorry.
What for?
Hello.
Hello, Sheldon.
You come to tell me you've moved me
to your ""super-secret enemies"" list?
I don't have a ""super-secret enemies"" list,
I'm not a Bond villain.
I'm just a regular guy
with a regular enemies list.
Which, by the way, you are no longer on.
Really. Well, that is something.
Not something that I care about,
but it is something.
-He's trying to say he's sorry.
-I am.
I watched your show and it's really good.
-Oh, thank you.
-And I regret how hard I was on you.
I want you to know
that being on the
Professor Proton Show...
...has been a childhood dream of mine...
...so if you're ever looking
for any more scientist guests...
...I hope you'll consider me.
I appreciate that, Sheldon.
And I'll keep it in mind.
-You know, actually--
-Yay!
No, no. I want to have more female scientists
represented on the show...
...and I thought maybe Amy
might be interested?
Or...
...wouldn't it be nice to have us both on...
...to show that even female scientists
can land a man?
I said sorry.
So, what do you think?
I like it.
I can't wait to see who the killer is.
Is it that Ilsa girl? She seems pretty mean.
But adorably mean? Like a baby lion?
No, regular mean. Like a regular lion.
But it seems pretty accurate
considering who you based it on.
Huh.
Who do you think that is?
But the door is locked,
so it has to be someone in this room.
Wow, you are on fire.
Oh, you--
Bernadette. Yeah, sure.
Each one of you had a motive.
-Who died and made you detective?
-He did.
I think you're neglecting your own motive...
...a massive inferiority complex.
It's not massive.
It's just average-sized.
I don't mean to interrupt,
somebody's tracking blood everywhere.
It's-- Oh, never mind, it's me.
You say we're all suspects.
-How do we know you're not the killer?
-I have an alibi.
Yeah. He's not smart enough
to pull off a murder like this.
It's pretty obvious. Blond, mean, glasses.
-It doesn't say glasses.
-Really?
But it will, because Ilsa does.
And you know who else wears them?
Bernadette.
And that's her. Because it's totally her.
Oh, Amy. Good, you're here.
Hi. What's up?
How would you like to be on television?
Is it gonna be a news story where I have to say
you were quiet and kept to yourself...
...and I'm as shocked as anyone?
No, it's not.
Wil Wheaton wants you
to be on
Professor Proton.
That's nice, but I'm not really interested.
What do you mean?
He wants to talk about women in science.
You're a woman. You're in science.
You go, girl.
I'm all for promoting women in science...
...but I don't really want to be on Wil's show.
Is it because kids may be there?
And they're known carriers of head lice?
I get that.
Sure, that's the reason.
Wait a minute.
You're always bragging that lice
aren't attracted to you...
...because your scalp is so oily.
It was on your dating profile.
Okay, look.
I know you have strong feelings
about
Professor Proton...
...and I don't want to get
in the middle of that.
So you're not going to do something
just because you think it might upset me?
Well, it's tricky,
because answering that question honestly...
...is one of the things I tend not to do
because it upsets you.
Well, that's very upsetting.
Like I said.
What other things don't you do
because of me?
Remember last week when we went to that
dueling piano bar I was so excited about?
-No.
-Now you're getting it.
Boy, I don't know how people who aren't
on bed rest keep up with the Kardashians.
Sometimes you have to read in your car
while your husband thinks you're working late.
Speaking of which, he came by yesterday
to show me his book.
Oh, and what did you think?
I liked it.
Really? The Ilsa character
didn't bother you?
Oh, he was exaggerating.
You're not really like that.
Well, I know I'm not like that.
The character was based on you.
I don't know what to tell you.
When I brought it up with Leonard,
he said it was you.
Well, when I brought it up he--
Got all squirrelly and left the room.
Son of a bitch.
I just learned some
very distressing news.
Sometimes Amy doesn't do things
because she's worried about how I'll react.
First of all, it's not sometimes, it's always.
Second, it's not Amy, it's everybody.
And third, it's not news, it's well-established.
Yeah, like just now, I wanted to get a croissant,
but I didn't wanna hear you say, ""Ooh-la-la.""
You're saying everyone walks on eggshells
to spare my feelings?
No, of course not.
We don't want to hear you complain...
...about how much you hate
the sound of crunching eggshells.
I don't want my relationship with Amy
to be like that.
Sheldon, Amy knew what she was getting into.
-You think?
-Yes, we warned her.
Well, regardless. I can change.
-Yeah, of course. Ha-ha.
-Sure you can.
Everybody thinks I'm so predictable.
Well, tomorrow, I'm going to show up at work
and do something no one will expect.
Wear a baseball cap backwards
to prove your point?
Yes, but which hat?
Gryffindor.
Now that you guessed it,
I'm not going to do it.
Yeah, you will.
Yeah.
[SCOFFS]
Looks like the bullet went right through you.
-Damn it, Logan, when are you gonna stop?
-Sorry, I didn't get my PhD in quitting.
You're a physicist,
what makes you think you can solve a crime?
He's losing a lot of blood.
Great, I'm going to have to clean that up.
You know what? A little soda water
might get that right out.
-We gotta find some bandages.
ILSA: No.
There's no time.
Does it hurt?
Everything you do hurts.
Then why do you keep coming back for more?
-Hey.
-So this is what you think of me?
I'm mean and everything I do hurts you?
-What are you talking about?
-I know I'm Ilsa.
What? That is crazy.
-You two are totally different.
-How?
Well, you've-- She--
Her name is Ilsa.
You know what? It's fine.
Write whatever you want.
By the way,
Logan Dean can tell everyone he's 5'8''...
...but he's not fooling anybody.
Are you sure that's the move
you want to make?
Absolutely.
Okay.
Checkmate.
Oh, I did not see that coming.
That's well played, Amy.
What's going on?
You beat me. And I'm responding
with humility and admiration.
What does it look like?
You let me win so you could show me
how emotionally mature you are, didn't you?
I couldn't wait for you to actually beat me.
That would take forever.
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to show you that I can change.
I don't want you to miss out on things
because of me.
I know you don't.
And maybe somewhere out there,
there is a little girl...
...who will see you on Wil's show...
...and realize that she too can grow up
to be a brilliant, amazing...
...successful scientist.
Thank you.
Who is really terrible at chess.
-Got it.
-No, no. I mean, really bad.
What was your queen doing over there,
going shopping?
I mean, I didn't intend to write about Penny...
...but I guess maybe subconsciously I did.
I believe you mean ""unconsciously,"" dear.
Yeah, sure. You know, it would be nice
if you didn't correct me all the time.
It'd be nice if I didn't have to.
Maybe this book of yours is a bad idea.
-What do you mean?
-You're a physicist.
What makes you think you can write a book?
You're a physicist.
What makes you think
you can solve a crime?
-Gotta go.
-I think you mean ""have to--""
Penny, good news. It's not you.
-What?
-Ilsa. It's not you.
It's my mother.
I've been writing about my mother.
I think you're neglecting your own motive.
A massive inferiority complex.
It's not massive. It's just average-sized.
We gotta find some bandages.
There's no time.
-Does it hurt?
-Everything you do hurts.
Then why do you keep coming back for more?
Maybe you like it.
I don't-- Maybe I do.
You know what, I'm a physicist,
what am I doing writing a book?
WIL:
Well, that is our show for today.
I wanna say a very special thank you
to Dr. Amy Fowler for being here.
It was a real pleasure having you.
And you can feel that pleasure
because you don't have a lesion in your...
...nucleus accumbens.
I really hope I don't.
All right, we'll see you next time.
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
[MUSIC STOPS]
-Amy. You were glowing.
-Heh.
Oily scalp.
I'm so proud of you.
And I'm proud of you.
Because you can't tell
how jealous I am?
No, no, no. I can.
But I can tell how hard
you're trying to keep it in.
Really hard.
-I'm going to bed.
-I'll go scream on the roof.
-Love you.
-Love you.

s11ep17.xml,"Oh, my God, I can't believe
how big Halley's getting.
Where's Howard?
-He's changing Michael.
-All done.
Fun fact, did you know
baby boys can pee straight up?
Grown-up boys too.
Why would we high-five that?
-So how are you guys?
-
Really good.
Except for when we went grocery shopping
and the checkout lady asked when I was due.
But you handled it well.
She did not handle it well.
If you guys need help,
I'd be happy to come over.
Oh, thanks, but we're trying to enjoy this
family time before we both go back to work.
-Okay, well, we all miss you.
-
You guys too.
Bye.
Boy, seeing them all together like that
has got my biological clock ticking like crazy.
-No, I don't think men have--
-I do.
-Hi.
-Hello.
Good news, we have save-the-date cards.
Didn't go with my calligrapher, interesting.
What is this picture?
It's an MRI of our brains
Photoshopped to look like they're kissing.
Is it too sexy?
It's too something.
-Guys, May 12th, that's exciting.
AMY: I know.
You have a location yet?
You don't have a lot of time.
It took us nine months to pick a date...
...and a week to decide if brains can have lips,
so get in the boat and row.
-Michael's out.
-So is Halley.
Oh, my God, he's so cute.
So is she.
-Switch?
-Yeah.
Oh, my God, he's so cute.
So is she.
I just love them so much.
Me too.
My heart feels like it's gonna explode.
Of course, it's full of brisket,
so it probably will.
I didn't even know I was capable
of loving someone so much.
More than me?
Wha--?
I'm just messing with you,
I totally love them more than you.
I get that. I would take a bullet for them.
But I would get seriously mutilated for you.
That's sweet.
But you should know if you got
seriously mutilated, I might dump you.
You'd be crazy not to.
Even unmutilated, I'm no prize.
I'm really happy with our wedding date.
The month squared equals the square
of the sum of the members...
...of the set of prime factors of the day.
Isn't that romantic?
Yes, it's like that Shakespeare sonnet:
Shall I compare thee to a day
That's also a really weird math problem?
It's a shame you're joking.
That'd be a lovely reading at our ceremony.
Well, we only have two months
to find a venue, and I had a thought.
What about the Athenaeum Club at Caltech?
Oh, Albert Einstein was a member there.
-It's beautiful.
-And Albert Einstein was a member there.
It's close.
And Albert Einstein was a member there.
-And Albert Einstein was a member there.
-Ehh.
Now you sound like a woman
who wants to get married.
-So you're interested?
-Of course, but that club is extremely exclusive.
Leonard's been trying to get us in
for years, but no luck.
That's odd, when I called
they said they'd be excited to give us a tour.
We can give it a look,
and if it doesn't work out...
...I hear there is a nearby Chinese restaurant
that Einstein used to frequent.
Or we pick a place we like
and don't worry about Einstein.
Boy, reality TV is right. Brides are crazy.
So how has it been
being home with two kids?
Tiring, but super rewarding.
Like Pilates, got it.
Honestly, it's gonna be hard
when we both go back to work.
I've been thinking maybe it would be better
if one of us decided to stay home.
I don't know, I was raised by servants,
and look at me.
I literally can't tell
if you think that's good or bad.
On one hand, they filled my tub with
scented oils and brought me honeyed sweets.
On the other hand, I spent my 20s
incapable of talking to women. So, you know...
...pros and cons.
Here's my dilemma. I kind of wanna stay home,
but Bernadette is a way better parent than I am.
-Does Bernadette wanna stay home?
-I don't know.
She's really invested in her career
and she's doing great.
I think it should be me.
Well, I admire you, Howard.
It'd be hard for me
to buck traditional gender roles like that.
Didn't you see Taylor Swift
twice this month?
Yeah, because she's hot,
not because she sings my truth.
Did Albert Einstein ever sit
in any of these chairs?
These are fairly new.
But Stephen Hawking's eaten here a lot.
Yeah, but he brings his own chair,
you know.
It seems kind of perfect.
And close to your office,
so you can use the bathroom you like.
I put a sticker over the auto-flush,
so it doesn't startle me.
Here's my card. You two talk it over,
and I will check to see...
...if our soup spoons
are ""deeper than they are wide.""
What? Too deep is a ladle, not a spoon.
I really like it.
Oh, I must admit, I do as well.
Look at how somber all the men
in these portraits are.
I feel like that sets a good tone
for our wedding.
Is that Leonard?
No, no, these are all
dead, accomplished scientists.
Leonard will only ever be
one of those things.
I mean, Leonard and Penny are right there.
But he told me he checked on our membership
just last week, and we were still 400th in line.
I'm sure there's an innocent explanation
that won't ruin my day at all.
-Leonard.
-Oh, hey.
-How did you get in here?
-What do you mean? Leonard's a member.
You told me it was incredibly exclusive.
Yeah, look, about that, I lied.
-Hey, wait, you told me it was exclusive too.
LEONARD: Mm-hm.
I avoided him and impressed you
all with the same lie.
Damn, Hofstadter,
I didn't think you had it in you.
I'm not sure I know
how I feel about this place now.
Then don't turn around.
Cooper.
Oh, good, you're here.
There's, ahem, something
I wanna talk to you about.
We're not putting a TV in the bathroom.
That's how you get hemorrhoids.
No, this is important.
I was thinking maybe one of us
should stay home full-time with the kids.
Great, so I have to give up my job,
and everything I worked for?
Actually, I was thinking I should stay home.
I have to abandon my children and go to work
while you stay home and bond with them?
You just said you didn't want to.
No, I don't wanna have to,
but if I want to, I should get to.
-Do you want to?
-Maybe I do.
-What if I also want to?
-Well, I don't know. We can't both stay home.
Don't you think you should go back to work,
because you make more money?
Don't you think
you should make more money?
I think it's pretty sexist of you to say
a dad can't stay home with his children.
You know what else is sexist?
The phrase ""suck it,"" yet here we are.
I can't believe Leonard lied to me.
What are we gonna find out next?
He's not really lactose intolerant?
AMY:
Hm.
SHELDON: He's just friends
with an invisible trumpet player?
I know you're upset, but if we wanna book
the Athenaeum, we really should do it now.
And then I promise we'll have our whole lives
to complain about Leonard.
Aw, somebody got a head start on her vows.
So do we agree?
Do we wanna get married there?
SHELDON:
I don't know.
I mean, Einstein was a member.
I like that, you know.
But Leonard's a member,
and that really steams my clams.
I love it when you're folksy.
I'm just gonna call.
On the other hand,
shaming Leonard during our wedding...
...at the very place he betrayed me
does have a beautiful symmetry to it.
That's nice. It'll be
your first petty act as a married man.
Oh, hi, Kathleen.
Yeah, this is Amy from earlier.
I'd like to go ahead and reserve May 12th.
Although, it is our wedding.
Maybe it shouldn't be all about revenge.
Oh, I see.
Okay, thanks.
Someone booked our date.
What? Who?
Well, well, well.
This is a pickle.
Yes, so if you will just move your birthday party
to a different location, everything will be fine.
It's tricky. I don't wanna move my party,
but I also don't wanna help you.
Oh, wait, I don't have a problem.
-No, I do.
-Yeah, you do.
-Morning.
-Hey, where you been?
Oh, nowhere special, just the park,
the farmers market...
...then Chinatown because it's important
for the kids to experience other cultures.
What have you been doing?
It's 8 a.m. Sleeping.
Oh, so are the kids.
I guess they take after you.
You're trying to prove
that you'd do a better job than me.
You're pretty sharp having just woken up.
Howard, we both know
you can't keep up this pace.
By this afternoon,
you'll be passed out on the couch...
...and I'm gonna have
three exhausted babies to deal with.
Not true, I got this. You know, in fact,
why don't you take the day off?
Fine. Maybe I'll have lunch with Penny.
Well, take your time, get a massage.
You deserve it
after all the sleep you've been getting.
-Maybe Barry will change his mind.
-Oh, I doubt it.
I said some pretty unprofessional things
about his work.
I may have even used the S-word.
Subpar?
I'm not proud of it, Amy, but I have a temper.
I suppose we could pick a different date.
It took you nine months to choose that one,
I'll pick a different husband first.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hey, I just-- I wanted to apologize
about the Athenaeum.
Why did you lie to me?
I don't know, it just seemed funny at first,
and then the longer it went on...
...the funnier it got.
So, yeah, I guess that's why.
-That's not much of an apology.
-Because he's not really sorry.
Obviously he wanted a place to go
where I wouldn't be.
And apparently all of outside
wasn't enough for him.
Come on, I do feel bad.
-Why? Did your best friend hurt your feelings?
-Sheldon.
I only have time to deal
with one jerk now. That's Barry Kripke.
-What?
-He has the Athenaeum booked...
-...for our wedding date and he won't give it up.
-So please leave before I get angry...
...and say something I will regret
about your face, height, personal hygiene...
...or the fact that your science,
whilst serviceable, lacks panache.
That's actually one of the nicest things
you've ever said about my work.
And now I regret it. Goodbye.
Hey, there you are.
Yeah, I just wanted to stop in
and see my office before we went to lunch.
-A few more weeks, you'll be back full-time, huh?
-Yeah.
That wasn't a happy ""yeah.""
That was a ""Hey, Leonard,
you wanna go to the gym?"" yeah.
I've just been thinking that maybe I'd rather
stay home with the kids and be a mom.
-Wow, that's big.
-I know.
Dr. Rostenkowski, I'm sorry,
I didn't know you were back.
Oh, I'm not. I just came
to meet Penny for lunch.
Is there anything I can get you?
Coffee, water?
-No, I think we're just gonna--
-Coffee sounds good.
-Cold brew, almond milk?
-Perfect.
Nothing for me. Ahem.
It's weird, I've been away so long,
I don't miss any of this.
[INTERCOM BUZZES]
MAN [ON INTERCOM]:
Sorry to bother you.
Dr. Lee heard you were here
and had a quick question.
Fine, put him on.
Jerold, what's going on?
Hope you're not screwing up my research.
You calling from a bike ride?
Because you're backpedaling hard.
Okay, fine. E-mail it over. I'll take a look.
-Ahem.
-Oh, sorry, where were we?
-Love your kids, don't miss your job.
-Right, right.
Nothing in the world
like holding your sleeping baby...
...knowing you make him feel safe and then--
Oh, good, you got the little cookies I like.
I wouldn't mind a cookie-- And he's gone.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
-Hey, Kripke.
-Hello, Hofstadter.
Why are you cleaning?
Don't you have grad students?
Come on, I can't make my grad students
do every dirty job.
Or so I've been told in writing
by the head of Human Resources.
Fair enough.
So look, I'm here to ask you to give Sheldon
and Amy the Athenaeum for their wedding.
[LAUGHS]
Why would I do that?
Because deep down,
Barry, you're a really good guy.
But am I?
Fine, what's it gonna take?
Barry, I've come to ask one more--
Leonard? Why are you doing that?
Because deep down,
Barry is not a good guy.
He's making you clean out
barrels of irradiated grease?
Yeah.
I made a deal with him
to get you the Athenaeum for your wedding.
Why would you do that?
Because I was a jerk for lying to you before.
And besides, you're my best friend.
I want you to have the wedding of your dreams.
On Mars?
Okay, I want Amy
to have the wedding of her dreams.
Well, thank you,
but I don't want you to do this.
-No, it's okay.
-No, it's not.
-We're not going to let Barry win.
-Well, what are we gonna do?
We have a combined IQ of 360.
Perhaps more, if that radiation
gave you a super brain.
Yeah, you're right.
If we work together,
we can totally outsmart Barry Kripke.
Leonard, my nose itches. What do I do?
-Oh, boy. I really passed out hard.
-Yeah, tell me about it.
The kids could've screamed bloody murder
and you wouldn't have woken up.
Which I know, because they did.
I'm sorry. Why did I think
I could do this on my own?
Hey, don't beat yourself up.
Parenting is hard.
Like, I've seen and smelled things today
that I cannot unsee or unsmell.
Thanks for covering for me.
No, I mean, he only drinks milk.
Like, where are the colors coming from?
-What time is it?
-It's almost 6.
Bernadette's gonna be home soon.
We gotta divide and conquer.
I'll make dinner, you watch the kids.
-Kids are asleep.
-Great, then you make dinner.
Hey, good news, Amy.
We got the Athenaeum.
Oh, my gosh, that's amazing.
How'd you get Barry to change his mind?
I couldn't have done it without Leonard.
You should've seen us. Like Batman and Robin.
Why do I have to be Robin?
If you have to ask, you're Robin.
-What happened?
-We scrubbed out barrels of irradiated grease...
...rinsed off in the safety shower, and then
told Barry Kripke what is what. Heh, heh.
And he just gave in?
-Well, we agreed to invite him to the wedding.
-Okay, no problem.
-And he gets to bring a date.
-That's reasonable.
And if she charges by the hour,
we have to cover it.
What else did you agree to?
Well, you know how Barry
has the voice of an angel?
He is not singing at our wedding.
He only wants to sing ""Volare.""
Oh, ""Volare.""
That's what he was saying.
Boy, I did not get that.
Guys, I appreciate everything you did, but we
can find another location that's just as good.
Maybe the Japanese Garden
or the planetarium.
The planetarium. I hadn't thought about that.
That's even better.
LEONARD:
Wait, what?
I scrubbed sludge for you,
and I may be slightly radioactive.
Oh, you're exaggerating.
Don't let him touch the silverware.
Why is Raj asleep on our couch?
I needed some help,
so he came by, played with the kids...
...read them some stories, put them down
for their nap, and made dinner.
What did you do?
Ate dinner.
Look, I don't think I'm cut out
to be a stay-at-home dad.
And since you want to,
you should stay home.
I do definitely want to,
but I know how much this means to you.
And it was just one day, so don't give up.
You don't wanna stay home either, do you?
When I went by the office, they gave me coffee
and cookies, and no one peed on me.
I miss that so much.
Well, I love the kids, but I also love my job...
...and sleep.
I know. I took a two-hour nap
on the couch in my office.
I took a three-hour nap
on the floor in the living room.
How do you feel now?
Honestly, still tired.
Me too.
-I love you.
-I love you too.
-And we'll figure this all out.
-Yeah.
Everyone's asleep.
You wanna head upstairs and,
heh, heh, you know...?
Let's just do it right here.

this before I run out of this.
It's like the movie
Speed,
but instead of a bus,
it's your lungs.
And instead of Sandra Bullock,
it has sadness.
this Russian paper?
Why did you pull
in this paper over here,
Oh, it was cited
we should check it out.
so I thought
Mm, it's not
translated.
Maybe we should talk to Howard;
his Russian's pretty good.
We don't need Howard.
I've got Google Translate.
Okay, here we go,
from Russian to English.
""Examinations of moose chowder
in lemon parachutes.""
Yeah, okay, now I know why
this app is free.
Oh, gosh, my Russian's
a little rusty.
If it helps, this word
may be ""moose.""
Okay.
This paper is called
""Examinations of a
Super-Asymmetric Model
of the Universe""
Gregora-poli-popivich.
by Dr. Vasily
W-Wait, so Amy
and Sheldon
to think of super-asymmetry?
weren't the first
No, doesn't look like it.
This is from 1978.
Okay, well, they might need
to rename their theory
Gregora-poli-popivich Theory.""
""The Cooper-Fowler
Kind of rolls right off
your tongue, doesn't it?
Sheldon is not gonna be
happy about this.
Well, he's gonna be less happy
about this, uh...
""The super-asymmetric model
""is inherently flawed
of further examination."" Hmm.
and does not bear the weight
So this disproves their theory?
Sounds like it.
Oh, how are we gonna tell him?
That's easy. Just go up to him
and say, ""Sheldon,
Raj has something to tell you.""
Why do I have to tell him?
You did find it.
I fou-- but he's the one
who translated it.
Okay, okay, h-how about this?
We all tell him.
Or even better: you tell him.
Yeah, that makes the most sense.
You guys are such cowards.
Yes, we are.
Hey, Denise. Is Stuart here?
Oh, no. Doctor's appointment.
Oh, is he okay?
Not since I've known him.
an interesting question.
Which brings up
You and Stuart. Why?
My parents owned a funeral home.
I don't know.
Read into that what you will.
What can I help you with?
I was hoping Stuart could show
me how to play
Fortnite.
Really, you good?
Mm, I can teach you.
Look at my skin. I haven't been
outside in six years.
So you'll coach me?
Sure. Now let me ask
you a question.
Howard. Why?
what do you think?
You got eyes--
(sighs)
(groans)
(mutters)
(groans, mutters)
(groans)
Wow, I really wish
I didn't see this.
Oh, hey.
I just need to give Sheldon
some bad news,
and I really don't want to.
No, I-I found a paper
Oh, my God. Is everything okay?
that proves their theory wrong.
They thought this was gonna
be their Nobel Prize.
It's gonna break his heart.
an anonymous note, you know,
Oh, man. Maybe leave
like in high school,
when you want to let
her boyfriend's cheating on her.
your best friend know that
you just tell her that?
Why wouldn't
Maybe you had a hickey.
I don't know.
to get bad news from a friend?
I-Isn't it better
Trust me, it's not.
with a hickey and a black eye.
I went to prom
Come on, knock on the door.
You can do this.
All right, a-all right,
here I go.
Oh, wait, just let me
get inside.
Why?
""Why""? Come on.
(door closes)
Oh, hey, Leonard.
Is the podcast too loud?
I didn't hear a podcast.
I told you no one could hear it.
so he's either in your earbuds
Well, I heard Ira Glass,
or clinging to the ceiling
like a gecko.
Actually, I-I need to talk to
both of you about your paper.
how are the citations coming?
Oh, right,
Well, Raj and I were
chasing them down
like you asked us to, and, um,
we came a-across a,
to disprove super-asymmetry.
a Russian paper that seems
Are you sure?
Yeah, uh, Howard translated it.
I'm so sorry.
Sheldon,
are you, are you all right?
Oh, yes, of course.
Thank you for telling us,
Leonard.
I'm sure that wasn't easy.
I guess we don't need
this anymore.
(sighs)
(screams)
So what are you listening to,
This American Life?
that chest and push X.
Okay, so walk up to
X. Push X.
Which one's X?
The one with the X on it.
Take it easy,
I'm new at this.
What, the alphabet?
You don't have to be snarky.
to play the game,
Hey, do you want
or do you want to crawl back up
and chow down like a baby?
your mommy's shirt
Damn, what is wrong with you?
wanted to beat your husband.
I'm sorry, I thought you
I do.
Well, then suck it up!
Okay!
(knocking on door)
Hi.
Can I do anything?
No.
I-I could sing ""Soft Kitty.""
I can make you some tea,
I don't understand how
you're not more upset by this.
This is your paper, too.
I am upset, Sheldon.
I'm just trying to hold
it together for you.
Like when that goose wouldn't
leave us alone at brunch.
That thing scared you, too?
I was wearing a down jacket.
Well, of course it did.
to pretend to be okay for me.
Well, I don't need you
that makes it worse.
If anything,
Fine. I'm not okay.
We came up with this idea
at our wedding.
of our lives into it.
We poured months
I thought we were changing
the course of science,
and now it's all gone.
I'm devastated.
that makes it worse.
I was wrong,
Go back to being happy.
(gunfire over computer)
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Hey.
what's it called again?
You, uh, playing that,
Fortnow?
Right.
Fortnite.
I guess I forgot 'cause I only
played it that one time
and I was so bad at it.
Don't beat yourself up.
It's a hard game.
Would you mind if I gave it
another shot?
Mm, maybe later, Berna...
Give me.
Where are you, Howard,
where are you?
Let me just build a little ramp,
get some height.
build-- oh, you already did it.
You want to press B to go into
Did I? I'm just hitting buttons.
Wee!
I'm coming for you.
I see your ramp.
(explosion sound effect)
You can try, but...
(chuckles)
Gotcha.
Son of a bitch.
Want to play again?
No!
Howard.
What?
I make more money than you.
You got yourself
a good one there, buddy.
showed up for work today?
So neither of them
No, I tried calling
and no one picked up.
Look, I'm sure
they're fine.
They were probably up all night
coming up with a new theory.
I-I also texted to see
if he wanted to go to the new
Fantastic Beasts
movie
and he didn't respond.
All right, well, they're already
dead. There's nothing we can do.
SHELDON:
Come in.
PENNY:
Hey...
Did-did you take the day off?
You guys look all comfy.
It's Saturday.
No, it's not.
Great, another thing
we're wrong about.
that make, Amy?
How many does
Two.
Two things.
What happened to us?
I'll tell you what happened.
Professor Gregoropovich.
I-I think it's
Gregora-poli-popivich, but...
Three.
you had a setback, you know?
Look, you guys, you had a,
This is the time you got to
dig in and-and try harder.
It's like halftime
and you're down by seven.
What are you doing?
All right,
it's-it's like
Bat-halftime and you're down
by Bat-seven.
Let me try.
You-you guys can't just give up.
the smartest people I know.
Uh, individually, you are
Together, you can do anything.
I appreciate what you're trying
to do but please stop.
You can't make this better.
I'm with Sheldon.
All right, Amy, listen...
We worked our butts off
on this paper
and it was all for nothing.
And if you think
some pep talk can fix that,
then you don't understand
how much this meant to us.
Is there anything we can do?
No.
Yeah-- wait.
Do I smell Siam Palace?
Oh, yeah, it's our dinner.
I mean, it's
your
dinner.
Any mango sticky rice?
PENNY:
No.
And the blows keep coming.
I see you. I see you...
(explosion sound effect)
and boom.
Gotcha! How's it feel, Penny?
Like I don't care at all.
Wrong, it feels bad because
you lost and I won.
Whoo! What a rush!
All right, can we go eat now?
All right.
Hell yeah.
Hey, how's it going?
Boom!
Okay, I'm-I'm gonna drive."
s12ep8.xml,"Hey, you guys have any
plans for Valentine's Day?
Three months from now? No.
What? No?
I mean,
secret romantic plans that
would be ruined if I told you.
Oh.
What's going on, Raj?
Well, how would
you guys feel
about going to India
for my wedding?
Oh, that's so exciting!
Penny, you will never guess
what I have planned
for Valentine's Day.
Uh-huh.
Can I feed peanuts to
the elephants at your wedding?
That is such a stereotype!
There won't be any elephants?
Of course there'll be elephants.
It's a stereotype
that you feed them peanuts.
Are you really gonna plan
a wedding in three months?
Yeah, well, her family's
doing most of the work.
They're amazing.
We talk all the time.
Why?
Because we're
about to get married
and they're gonna be my family.
Amy and I are married, and
I never talk to her family.
Really? My parents
love Leonard.
Yeah. And my mom loves
Penny, which is weird,
because I never
knew she could love.
And my dad has grown
to really...
like Howard.
Yeah, there's a nice...
coolness between us.
Hey, guys,
before Anu gets here,
can I talk about
the seating situation?
I really don't want her
to sit on the floor.
Oh. No problem.
Bernadette, floor.
Hey!
Yeah, you can't
make my wife
sit on the floor.
Fine.
Howard, floor.
Fine, I'll sit on the floor.
Thank you, Penny.
And, Leonard,
I was kind of hoping
I could sit next to Anu.
So now
I
have to
sit on the floor?
It's my house.
Why can't Sheldon
sit on the floor?
That might be
the dumbest thing
you've ever said.
WOLOWITZ:
Guys, guys,
there's a simple solution.
I am not breaking up with her.
All right. Let's
keep thinking.
Hey, everybody, it's Anu.

I should not have eaten
all those dumplings.
(chuckles)
I think we should have sex.
(passing horn honks)
(squeakily):
Me, too.
Yeah, it's just,
we haven't done it yet,
and I think it's important
to make sure we're compatible
before we get married.
I totally agree.
Oh, just one question.
While we're doing it,
can I leave my shirt on?
You know, the dumplings,
pretty salty.
It doesn't have
to be tonight.
How about this weekend?
I can get us a room
at my hotel.
Okay. Sounds nice.
We can order
a bunch of room service,
because I'm not eating anything
between now and then.
Aw. Are you worried?
I am not worried.
If anything, I'm overconfident.
Edging into smug.
I'm sure it's
gonna be fine.
Oh, it's gonna be
better than fine.
Trust me,
I've had no complaints.
Good to know.
Well, I've had
questions, comments,
some constructive criticism,
(snorts):
but... no complaints.
You're up early.
Huh? Yes. I wanted
to get a jump
on planning
a day of fun for you.
Oh, that's sweet.
What are we doing?
Oh, no. Just you.
I have other plans.
Now, would you prefer
to see
The Grinch
in 2-D or 3-D?
I don't want to see it at all.
Well, let's go 2-D. No sense
in spending extra money.
What are you
gonna be doing?
Being a great husband.
Yeah, you're gonna need
to show your work on that.
After last night,
I got to thinking
that I should have a better
relationship with your family.
I think the one you have
with them is perfect.
I hardly have one at all.
Which is perfect.
Oh, Amy, they're
important to you,
and you're
important to me.
Therefore, according to
the transitive property,
they're important to me.
It's the same reason
I'm interested
in your big, flat feet.
Well, you know
that my mom can be...
well, difficult
to get along with.
Which is why
I'm starting with your dad
and working my way up.
All right.
I'm just worried
you might have
a rather unpleasant day.
Yeah, back at ya.
I watched the trailer
for
The Grinch--
it looks terrible.
(knocking)
Hi, Sheldon.
Oh, good.
You're right on time.
Hi, Daddy.
Hey, pumpkin.
Pumpkin? I've been
calling her spaghetti squash.
It's amazing
that one woman
can be different vegetables
to different men.
Bye.
Bye.
So, how does this work
with in-laws?
Am I supposed
to be calling you Dad?
Because I don't want to.
You don't have to.
Oh, thanks, Larry.
Ooh. That doesn't
sound right.
(gasps) Maybe I should pick
a vegetable for you.
(video game noises on TV)
Hey, Leonard, can you pause
the game for a second?
Uh, hang on.
I'm about to beat Howard.
What? Hey!
What?
He's our friend.
What's up, pal?
I... I don't know
how else to say this,
but, um, Anu and I are going
to have sex tonight.
Yeah...
Do you know how creepy
that sounds?
Yeah...
So, is this the first time?
Yeah.
How you feeling
about it?
Uh...
to be honest,
I'm pretty anxious.
I mean, this is the woman I'm
marrying-- what if it's no good?
Do we break up?
Do we...
sign on for a lifetime
of mediocre sex?
Just don't put
so much pressure on it.
It's always a little awkward
in the beginning.
I remember the first time
I slept with Penny.
It was bad?
Oh, it was awesome!
I will replay it in my head
until the day I die.
WOLOWITZ:
Well, if it helps,
I was really nervous
my first time with Bernie.
Mostly because I was worried
my mom would walk in.
Did she?
Yea-- Yeah.
BERNADETTE:
I'll tell you
one thing.
Lock the door.
Yeah, Raj, you're
gonna be fine.
Just break out some
of your Kama Sutra moves.
I don't really know
any of that stuff.
I just pretend I do
to impress women.
And by the way,
Anu is Indian--
she's gonna know
there's no sexual position
called a ""screeching lotus.""
Screeching lotus?
Sometimes I get leg cramps.
It's my cover story.
Look, she's probably
nervous, too.
Yeah, what if
you're
great
and
she's
bad?
How can she be bad?
Raj, women can be
bad at sex, too.
(laughs):
No, that's silly.
Hey, have you checked
the dates on these?
They're all expired.
You buy candy in a comic book
store, you get what you get.
It's called
Lethal Weapon,
but isn't that
redundant?
Aren't weapons,
by their very nature, lethal?
I suppose you're right.
Yeah, and don't even get me
started on
Unsolved Mysteries.
I didn't get you started
on
Lethal Weapon.
All right, this is another one
of my favorite places,
the comic book store.
Feel free to look around.
Vintage comics in back,
vintage candy right here.
What are you guys up to?
Oh, father-in-law,
son-in-law bonding.
It's going great.
Look at what he bought me
at the train store.
(blows whistle)
Yeah, it sounded louder
in the car.
Cool. Can I see it?
Hmm? Sure.
Oh. Interesting.
I think this is one of those
disappearing whistles.
What are you
talking about?
(claps hands)
Voilà!
Amazing.
Where did it go?
Look in your pocket.
(gasping):
Oh! Oh!
Oh, how did you do that?
Sorry, a magician
never shares his secrets.
I'll give you
a hundred bucks.
Sold!
Okay.
Hey.
Where's my wallet?
Voilà!
Hey, Penny.
I need your help.
I am freaking out.
Okay, is she there yet?
No, I got here first.
You know...
get the lay of the land.
Raj, it's gonna be okay.
Look, sex isn't
the most important thing
in a relationship.
My first time with Leonard
was nothing to write home about.
Really?
Yeah, but, you know,
over time it got better.
S-So practice makes perfect?
Well, practice makes better.
(phone chimes)
Oh, my God, oh, my God, she just
texted. She's on her way up!
Raj, calm down.
You got this.
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
I got this.
Just remember, the most
important thing is to have fun.
Stop putting
so much pressure on me!
Hi.
Everything okay?
Why are you acting
so weird?
Raj? What's going on?
(champagne cork pops)
Be right out!
You look beautiful!
Sorry, I had to use
the facilities.
With a bottle of champagne?
Mm, I like to celebrate
the little things in life.
You need to go?
There's still some left.
Raj, what is going on?
No, no, it's not
what's going on,
it's what's comin' off.
Stop it.
You're acting weird,
and it's freaking me out.
Why? Because I couldn't talk
and ran in the bathroom
to slug back a
bottle of champagne
when I pretended to pee?
Okay, I think I'm gonna leave.
No, no, wait, wait,
don't-- okay, don't go.
Fine. Then tell me
what's going on.
Well, funny story...
The truth.
Oh, God, the truth is
so not good for me!
Voilà.
Darn it.
It's okay.
Here, let me
show you again.
It's like you're
actually magic.
You can do that but you still
can't get my bra off.
The rings don't roll
their eyes at me.
Excuse me, Turnip,
we need to get going.
But-but Howard was gonna show me
some close-up magic.
Well, if you want
to see real magic,
I'll take you
to Union Station,
home to trains, subways
and busses that,
every half hour-- voilà--
drive to the airport.
I'd like to stay,
if you don't mind.
Oh, not at all.
Howard. A word.
What's up?
I need you to stop
being so delightful.
What?
I'm supposed to be
bonding with him.
You have your own father-in-law;
leave mine alone.
Tell you what, you take my
father-in-law, I'll take yours.
I don't want
your father-in-law.
What if I throw in
a quarter?
Do it again.
Do it again.
Mrs. Fowler.
Mrs. Fowler.
Mrs. Fowler.
Sheldon, what's going on?
Where is Larry?
Oh, Turnip's out;
I'm bonding with you.
Okay, you wanted the truth,
here it is.
You have a drinking problem.
No. I, uh,
I have a talking problem,
and a drinking solution.
What does that mean?
(sighs)
Oh, Anu, for
most of my life,
I got so nervous
around women
that I couldn't talk
to them without alcohol.
So you've been drunk every time
we've seen each other?
No. No. It hasn't
happened in a long time.
And I really thought
I was over it,
but I guess...
I-I don't know,
I guess I-I wanted so much
for tonight to go well,
that I-I stressed
myself out.
It came back.
(sighs)
Why didn't you tell me
about this before?
I was embarrassed.
I get that.
If it makes you
feel any better,
I've got things
I'm embarrassed about, too.
Really? Will you
tell me one?
Okay. Um...
Ugh. I hate
telling people this.
I don't like music.
What kind of music?
Just all of it.
It sort of seems
like a waste of time.
Even Beyoncé?
See, this is why
I don't tell people.
No. Um, it's fine.
It's just,
have you heard
""Single Ladies""?
Yeah, and I don't get it.
I mean, the lyrics are
""Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.""
Y-You have to sing it in
the voice of a goddess.
Like: ♪ Oh, wa-ah, oh ♪
♪ Wa-ah, oh ♪
♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪
♪ Wa-ah, oh. ♪
(laughs)
My point is, we both have
our little eccentricities.
Little eccentricities?
One is a deep-seated
psychological disturbance,
and the other can be solved by
half a glass of chardonnay.
So the doctor prescribed Nizoral
and it blocked enzyme action,
and the fungus
cleared right up.
That's a very
disturbing picture.
Yes, well, they say a picture's
worth a thousand words,
but I say nothing beats a
picture and a thousand words.
Still, you might want
to take it off Facebook.
Oh, no. It's in my nature
to share.
So, your turn.
Uh, other than Amy,
have you ever had anything
removed from your body?
I am not going to answer that.
Smart. Save something for
our next get-together.
Oh, we should commemorate
this one with a selfie.
Oh, look at us,
two peas in a pod.
Oh, speaking of vegetables,
how about I start calling you
Old Lady Green Beans?
Hey, you look
deep in thought.
Ah, I'm just reflecting.
About what?
The first time
we slept together.
Oh, honey. Don't beat
yourself up; it's great now.
This is not good.
Sheldon is hanging out
with my mom.
Yeah. O-One sec.
W-What do you mean,
""don't beat myself up""?
AMY:
Guys, focus.
My mom thinks
that Sheldon is the reason
I don't spend a lot of time
with her.
Well, why would
she think that?
Because I told her.
You need a cup of coffee?
Wake up!
So you've been using Sheldon
as an excuse
to get out of
seeing your mother?
(sighs) I know.
I feel terrible.
I love my mom but,
you know, sometimes...
Yeah. We-We've met her. Yeah.
And it's easier to say
I can't spend time with her
because of Sheldon than to admit
that I just, I don't want to.
Totally understandable.
I'll ask again,
what do you mean,
""don't beat myself up""?
And then you ask me 20
questions to try to determine
which Nobel Prize-winning
physicist I am.
Ready? Go.
Can I give up?
No. 19 questions left.
(ringtone playing)
Are you gonna get that?
Oh, no. We're in the
middle of a game.
18 questions left.
Answer the phone,
Sheldon.
Hello, Amy.
Hey, how's it going?
Well, Howard lured your dad away
with magic,
so now I'm bonding
with your mom.
I think she likes me.
I'd like you a lot better
if you weren't keeping
my daughter away from me.
Uh, wh-- Hang on, Amy.
What's the problem,
Green Beans?
Amy said she couldn't come
to Thanksgiving dinner
because you always have
to spend it with your mother.
I haven't spent Thanksgiving
with my mother in years.
Amy, why would you tell
your mother
that I spend Thanksgiving
with my mother?
Uh, no time
to talk about that now.
All your action figures
are on fire.
Harrison Ford's in the lobby.
Come quick.
And Amy never joins us
for Sunday dinners
because you refuse to go out
on a school night.
Sh-- I can go out
on a school night
as long as I'm in
my PJs by 10:00.
Sheldon, don't listen to her.
She doesn't know
what she's talking about.
She's crazy!
Hello, Amy.
Hello, Mother.
Great news. We-we can come
for Thanksgiving this year.
I can't believe it.
All this time
I've been angry at you
when I should have
been angry at Amy.
Look at that.
We're both angry at Amy.
Maybe that's something
we could bond over.
Let me ask you this:
how do you feel about Howard?
Oh, is he that odd little friend
you have with the haircut?
I may have married
the wrong Fowler.
Why would Amy feel
the need to lie to me?
Well, perhaps because
you're her mother
and she didn't want
to disappoint you.
Really?
Even after she threw you
under the bus,
you're still
gonna defend her.
Oh, yes.
She's my wife
and I love her.
And if I can forgive her for
putting ketchup on her eggs,
I can forgive her for this.
Her father does that,
it's disgusting.
Amy's crazy,
you are a delight.
Good morning.
Mm. Good morning.
I ordered some coffee for us.
Oh, fantastic.
(sighs)
Last night was...
wonderful.
(sighs) But all we
did was talk.
Yeah. And it was wonderful.
Am I safe to assume
you talking to me now
is a good sign
for our marriage?
(chuckles) Yeah,
and-and for my liver.
Hey, about the other thing.
Um...
Should we just wait
for another night?
Or I go take a shower,
and you decide how
you want to play this.
Take a shower with me, Raj.
Thank you, Amy.
It's so nice of you
to have us over for dinner.
(chuckles) Couldn't think
of a single reason not to.
Yeah, and boy,
did she try.
Thank you, honey.
Oh, you're welcome, dear.
Would anyone like to see the
magic trick Howard taught me?
I'd love to see your trick,
Daddy.
A perfectly ordinary
table knife.
(exhales)
Watch closely.
Voilà.
Oh, my gosh,
that was so good.
Well, look,
there's fake blood, too.
I'll be right back.
I don't know about you,
but I don't really like magic.
You just keep getting
better and better."
s11ep16.xml,"Howie, Howie, wake up. It's time.
-Did your water break?
-No.
-Are you feeling any contractions?
-No.
-Wait, where are you going?
-To the hospital.
Today's my due date,
and this crap needs to end now.
Honey, babies don't always
come on their due date.
Halley was two weeks late.
But this baby is a boy.
They don't take as long to get ready.
-What are you doing?
-I'm making the situation better with humor.
Are you?
Would you rather me
make it better with magic?
-Go back to sleep.
-Ta-da.
-You know, I hear that sex can induce labor.
-Anything for my family.
I believe today is Bernadette's due date.
Yeah. How do you know that?
Easy, 40 weeks from the date
of her last period.
And why do you know that?
Well, excuse me
for taking an interest in people.
So any day now?
Oh, I don't know.
We went to the doctor this morning.
-She said it could still be another week or two.
-How's Bernadette holding up?
It's pretty rough. She's having a hard time.
-Why are you smiling?
-I had sex twice last night.
That's not fair. She's on bed rest.
She can't run away.
It was her idea.
She read that it can start labor.
Hmm. Is that true?
I would've Googled it,
but I was busy taking my pants off.
Not to brag, but Amy's last birthday
brought my coital tally up to four.
Whatever you're doing, it's not bragging.
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.
-Hey, I was just talking about you.
-Oh, should I ask?
You should not.
I'm getting our grant proposal together.
You finish up those mechanical drawings?
-I was gonna do it last night, but I got busy.
-Yeah, you did.
-What are they talking about?
-I'll give you a hint.
It's something that we have done four times.
-Watched
La La Land?
-What? No, no.
I've not watched
La La Land
four times.
If you find the soundtrack on my phone,
it's because our iTunes accounts are linked.
Looks like I might have more time
before the baby gets here...
-...so why don't we stay late and get it done?
-Don't leave Bernadette alone.
-We can keep her company.
-Absolutely.
Look at my Netflix queue, two documentaries,
and the movie
Friends with Benefits...
...which I thought was a documentary
about employer healthcare plans.
Hey, Bernie, it's me. I let myself in.
Hey.
What are you doing?
I thought you were on bed rest.
That's done, but I've been on stair rest
for the last 45 minutes.
Here, let me help you.
You really wanna help, put on a rubber glove,
reach on up there, and start pulling.
I know you're joking,
but I grew up on a farm. I'll do it.
I just want this to be over.
When my yoga instructor was pregnant...
...she told me there were poses
that put her into labor.
I'll try, but I feel like bendy poses
are what got me into this mess.
Okay, we're gonna start
with some nice breathing exercises.
[BREATHING DEEPLY]
Sorry, I can't think of anything
except how flat your belly is.
Oh, thank you.
Go put on some more clothes, you bitch.
Okay, we go down.
And back up.
-And back up.
-Yeah, hearing you is not the problem.
-Put that phone away.
-Smile.
I'm telling you, there's an acupressure point
right above your ankle...
...that can induce contractions.
All right, but just a warning,
my feet are a little swollen.
Oh, please, Bernadette, I'm sure it's-- Okay.
-What?
-Nothing. Your ankles look fine...
...and not at all like I just popped open
a can of crescent rolls.
My mom believes
if you're not prepared mentally...
-...it can delay your body from going into labor.
-So are you trying to say it's my fault?
[EXHALES]
Raj is crazy. Your ankles aren't that gross.
Hello.
Let me guess, you're here to try
to get me to go into labor.
Oh, please. I'm disgusted when people sneeze,
and that's just stuff coming out of their nose.
No, I am here to sit with you
and keep you company.
Oh, that's nice.
By playing the most complicated
board game ever invented...
...Campaign for North Africa.
I bought it off eBay. It smells a little like chili,
but all the pieces are there.
Come on, baby, get out here right now,
and I'll buy you a pony.
-Are there engineers on the grant committee?
-I don't know. Why?
I didn't have time to figure out
the three-input hydraulic manifold...
...so this diagram is just
a flux capacitor from
Back to the Future.
I'm sorry this is on such short notice.
Hey, I just wish I could be there
when you present it.
That's okay. It's more important
that you spend time with Michael.
Who's Michael?
-Your son.
-No, it's not.
My son doesn't have a name yet.
Okay, well, then Bernadette's son.
I can't believe her. She knows
I don't wanna name the baby after her dad.
What did you wanna name him?
We were gonna wait
until we saw what he looked like.
Well, it's a baby,
and her dad's a wrinkly bald man.
That wasn't gonna break your way.
Oh, come on.
Welcome to the next
five to eight weeks of your life.
Sheldon, I said
I didn't wanna play your game.
Well, then don't think of it as a game.
Think of it as a source of information...
...about one of the lesser-known
campaigns of World War II.
-You're right, that's so much better.
-I know, right?
Okay, first we need to roll
to determine the weather.
It's a desert. Isn't it gonna be hot?
Yes.
Michael? Really?
You think we're naming him Michael?
Not now, Howard.
I'm in the middle of a game.
You wish. You are hundreds of hours
away from the middle.
I can't believe you're trying
to hijack our son's name.
Bernie?
BERNADETTE:
This is as fast as I move. Calm down.
So you're just gonna name him Michael?
Were you even gonna tell me?
-I told you.
-When?
Oh, right, that was Amy.
What's wrong with Michael?
It's my dad's name.
I don't want to name our son
after your father.
I didn't wanna say this, but he's dying.
He is?
Eventually. I mean,
you see the way the man eats.
Okay, is this the hormones,
or have you always been a lunatic?
I don't even know anymore.
Bernie, this is our kid's name.
I think we should both agree.
You're right. We both made this baby.
-Thank you.
-And I carried it...
...had to stay in bed for four months,
sacrifice my body and my job...
...and soon it's gonna burst its way
out of me, like the Kool-Aid Man.
Exactly, fifty-fifty.
I think I got Bernadette in trouble.
Maybe we should go.
I can't, she and I are playing
Campaign for North Africa.
She doesn't wanna play that.
Neither did the Egyptians,
but that didn't stop Rommel.
Hey, I brought Chinese.
And I brought Indian.
-What are you doing here?
-Sheldon texted...
...and said Bernadette
wanted us all to come over.
The game's best with five to 10 players.
If it's not Michael,
then what do you wanna name him?
Harry, like Potter or Houdini.
It doesn't bother you that
I have an old boyfriend named Harry?
Okay. Ahem.
How about Al, or Max, or Ted, or Kevin?
Same answer.
Hey, Bernadette, it's your turn.
Penny's Air Force
is strafing your supply line in Tobruk.
-We're kind of busy.
-Okay, but you're being pretty rude.
Everyone did come over
to play this game with you.
You know, I always thought Christian
was a nice name.
I don't know, it sounds
a little too uncircumcised.
-Bernadette, it's your turn.
-What about Greg?
All right, I'll just roll for you.
Oh, that is a good one.
Your troops' morale rating is pretty high.
Now, Leonard, as the defender,
we need to subtract your morale rating...
...from Bernadette to get a final
adjusted morale rating for the assault.
And I will just check
the assault differential column.
Oh, who said war was hell?
Yeah, that's a rhetorical question.
Sherman said it.
What about Sherman?
Like Sherman Wolowitz.
Yeah, that's a kid
who's gonna take his mother to prom.
Hey, Howard, you did that, right?
I didn't take her, she chaperoned,
heh-heh, and we slow-danced once.
What about Paul?
Paul. Paul Wolowitz.
I like it.
Like Koothrappali.
Okay, you ruined it.
All right, that moves us on
to the tactical shipping phase.
Penny, I believe,
as logistics commander, that's you.
Okay, I surrender.
Nice try, Penny. It takes more
than everybody not enjoying it...
...to stop a game with Sheldon Cooper.
We're talking about
something important here.
Fine, if you pick a baby name,
can we get back to playing?
-Sure.
-All right, here we go.
Ranatanata.
You can't name him Ranatanata.
Oh, right, it's a boy. That'd be ridiculous.
What about Ozymandias?
Are you making these up
or having a stroke?
Ozymandias is from a poem
by Percy Bysshe Shelley.
Oh, Bysshe Wolowitz.
Solved, back to the game.
Oh, sandstorm.
Well, some people
name their kids after places.
Like what, Walla Walla Wolowitz?
If you think that is better
than Ozymandias Wolowitz...
...then you have been breathing in the
poisonous gas my troops illegally dispersed.
Ooh.
-You okay?
-I think that was a contraction.
Is it time? Do we need to go to the hospital?
We've been through this before.
My water hasn't even broken yet.
Never mind your water.
Has your mucus plug popped out?
-No.
SHELDON: Oh, you're right.
We probably would've heard that.
It's not a champagne cork.
Although that would be festive.
-Maybe we should go.
-Did you have another contraction?
No, I'm just worried that Sheldon's
gonna say mucus plug again.
And I'm worried one's gonna
hit me in the eye.
-Yup, it's time.
-Should we take two cars?
Could you stay and watch Halley? Then
we don't have to wait for Bernadette's parents.
You go, we'll take care of her.
You have nothing to worry about.
Well, not nothing. There are U-boats
approaching the Suez Canal.
It's too late for us. Go, go. Save yourselves.
Suez, birth? It's a big night for canals.
How you feeling?
Eh.
But I am really excited to meet our son.
Me too. I thought I'd be super freaked out,
but I'm ready for this.
Well, not the part where you're in labor
and you squeeze my fingers till they turn blue.
I'm sorry, that must be really painful for you.
It is. I mean, last time--
Okay, I see what you're doing.
Ooh, ooh, ooh., Ow.
It's a big one.
Just breathe.
[BREATHES DEEPLY]
Okay, okay, I'm good.
-Sorry I tried to sneak the name past you.
-That's okay.
I'm sorry I used up
so many good names in college.
I was really competitive with my roommate.
Forget about it. Heh.
Please.
Maybe we're putting
too much pressure on this.
It doesn't matter what we name him.
He'll be amazing.
You're right. This kid
is part you and part me.
Yeah, he's gonna be smart,
and kind, and funny.
If he cracks 5-foot-6, it'll be a miracle.
I've always liked the name Elliott.
Sorry, can't have it. That's my boy name.
-I said it first.
-It's not like calling dibs.
Yes, it is, it's exactly like that.
Dibs on Elliott.
I'm just saying, we might get there first.
You only have sex once a year.
I'll probably have sex tonight.
Fine, you can have Elliott.
When did you pick out our kids' names?
Remember that day
you moved into the building?
Yes.
A non-creepy amount of time after that.
Yeah, I like the name Elliott.
That wasn't on my list, but I like it.
But we've heard your names.
They're ridiculous.
And I have a cousin named Dileep.
Well, I wasn't going to give them
any of the good names.
I'm saving those for us.
Really? You've thought about our kids?
Of course. I think you and I
will have exceptional children.
Oh? Well, I think so too.
How many kids do you guys want?
-Fifteen.
-Two.
-What?
-Well, don't worry.
I don't expect you to bear them all.
I'm sure we can find
a suitable uterus to rent.
-No.
-Uh-uh.
-We weren't thinking about you.
-Of course not.
I am going to the kitchen.
Can I get anybody anything?
Penny, nice glass of milk
and a multivitamin?
SHELDON:
Guys.
Guys, wake up. Terrible news.
Oh, my God. What? Is it the baby?
No, no, no, we miscalculated
our unassigned armor class units.
We need to start over.
-What?
-No, not from the beginning.
-Just from when the tanks started moving.
-That was five hours ago.
No, no, that was two hours ago.
It only feels like five.
-What time is it?
-Almost 2:30.
-Should we have heard something?
-I'm sure they're fine.
I'm calling them. Ahem.
[LINE RINGING]
-
Hey.
-Hey, everything okay?
Yeah, the baby was born about an hour ago.
Dude, why didn't you call me?
The only way I would see my son
for the first time...
...and immediately think
""I need to call Raj"" is if he came out brown.
It can take some time for pigment to form.
You're still not out of the woods.
Well, congratulations.
-Yeah, hey, what'd you name him?
-
Neil Michael.
Neil for Armstrong, Gaiman, and Diamond.
Michael because Bernie
had to get six stitches.
Neil, that's cute.
BERNADETTE:
But we're calling him Michael.
I'm not gonna fight her. That kid's head
was the size of a cantaloupe."
s11ep2.xml,"Uh, one dumpling left, who wants it?
Maybe you should offer it
to the pregnant lady.
And that would be...?
Me, Sheldon, I'm obviously pregnant.
You never said it to my face,
and the last time I assumed...
...a woman was pregnant,
it did not go over well.
Yeah, I'm still mad at you. Ahem.
You were drinking water instead of wine,
what was I supposed to think?
Sheldon's right,
I would never ask a woman...
...if she's pregnant unless she tells me
or I see a human being wiggling out of her.
Well, Sheldon, I'm pregnant.
Congratulations. How far along are you?
-About three months.
-Only three?
Good gravy, how many babies are in there?
Okay, let's talk about something that
won't infuriate my pregnant wife.
-I read an interesting fact about elephants--
-Try again.
I've got something.
I'm being interviewed
on public radio this Friday.
-Cool, how come?
-The university's trying to get funding...
...for the physics department.
They want me to talk it up.
Really, you?
[WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY]
Well, they picked
the right person for the job.
-Thank you.
-I think he bought it.
Hi, I'm Ira Flatow,
and this is
Science Friday.
Joining me today is my guest,
physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter...
...to talk about all the exciting research
they're doing at Caltech.
Thank you for having me. Whoa. Heh.
I never get used to hearing myself
in headphones.
-Is that really how I sound?
-Heh-heh.
It is. It is.
[IN DEEP VOICE]
That is good to know.
I told him his voice was annoying,
he didn't wanna listen.
-Hey.
-You're saying it's not?
Just-- Hey.
So it's been five years
since the discovery of the Higgs boson.
What's the next big thing gonna be?
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Wow, that's hard
to say, there's so much going on.
We've been collecting tons of data
that could revolutionize...
...the way we understand the universe.
For instance,
there's a particle called a squark...
...which could prove supersymmetry.
-That is interesting. Have you found it?
-The squark?
-Yes.
-No, no.
Wouldn't that be exciting? Heh.
But we're also looking for the selectron,
the gluino, the neutralino.
-Oh, and have you found--?
-No.
Fun side note,
I went to high school with a girl...
...named Theresa Gluino.
But it didn't cost 2 billion dollars
to find her.
She was smoking behind the gym. Heh.
So, what have you found?
Uh, nothing, actually.
Should he be saying that?
Oh, probably not.
Yeah, this is public radio.
Doesn't he realize
dozens of people might hear him?
But I remain confident.
We've got the best equipment...
...and the best minds all working on it.
Okay, sounds like he's back on track.
Although, some days I'm like,
""Ugh, we've spent so much money.
Why haven't we found anything?
What are we doing?""
Oh, boy.
There's Leonard.
I bet he's having a rough day. Heh.
-Let's just try to be supportive.
-Supportive?
He publicly maligned
the love of my life, Lady Physics.
You might not wanna mention that
to Lady Fiancée.
-Hey, guys.
RAJESH: Hey. How's it going?
Pff.
What? You got something to say?
I think I just said it.
P-F-F.
Pff.
Look, I was just speaking the truth.
We're scientists,
isn't that what we're supposed to do?
What would you know about the truth?
You thought
Phantom Menace
was
""Not half bad.""
I told you that in confidence.
Okay, calm down, everybody just cool it.
No, let them go. If we get lucky,
maybe one of them will start crying.
Can we just drop this
and have lunch like adults?
-Very well.
-Sure.
-Leonard.
-What?
Pff.
You ready for lunch?
Oh. One second.
Ooh, someone's got a lot
of fancy new lab equipment.
I know, the university's been
throwing money at my study.
With any luck, there'll be a brain disease
with my name on it.
Fingers crossed.
Which is ironic because
if you had Fowler's Palsy...
...you wouldn't be able to cross your fingers.
I'm surprised Sheldon's not up here
playing with all your new toys.
Actually, I haven't told him about it.
We've been getting...
...so much more funding,
he's been a little sensitive.
So you're just gonna hide
your success from him?
I know. Am I terrible?
No, I do that too.
Howie thought my company retreat
was in Boise.
It was in Tahiti.
That's such a relief.
Part of me was worried
I was being unfair to Sheldon.
Take that part of yourself and hide it away.
Just like last year's bonus check
that I ""didn't get.""
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
-Ms. Davis, you wanted to see me?
-Yes, Dr. Hofstadter, come on in.
Should I sit or stand? I'm not used
to being called into the dean's office.
Please sit.
-I have to say, I'm a little nervous.
-You should be.
Look, I know I screwed up,
but it was only one interview.
How much damage could it have caused?
Would you like me to read you
the emails from donors...
...asking why they're giving us money
if physics is a dead end?
I didn't say it was a dead end.
I just said that I was worried it might be.
So if I just said I was worried
you might not have a job next week...
...how would you feel?
Light-headed
and glad you asked me to sit down.
Okay, just tell me what I can do.
I'm gonna need you to make a statement
saying that you misspoke...
...and you're confident
the physics community is close...
...to a major breakthrough.
You want me to lie?
Look, Dr. Hofstadter, I'm counting on you.
I think you're the smartest physicist
at this university.
-Really?
-See, lies, they're not that hard.
[DOOR OPENS]
-Hi.
-Hello.
Huh. Looks like you've been busy.
Oh, I have.
Uh, dark matter, reconciling gravity
and quantum mechanics, supersymmetry.
I figured out the biggest problems
in physics today.
Wow, you solved them all?
No, I just-- I figured out
that they're the biggest problems.
Is this about
what Leonard said on the radio?
Absolutely not.
And I do not want to talk about Leonard.
Can we talk about anything else?
We could talk about my day.
Walked right into that one, didn't I?
Well, since you sort of asked,
I actually had a very good day.
I got some new equipment for my lab.
Well, congratulations.
I got some new equipment too.
I got these markers.
They smell like fruit...
...which I did not notice when I bought them.
Don't really care for it.
Here, drink this.
It might help.
-What if it doesn't?
-That's why I brought the bottle.
No one would talk to me in the halls,
they just glared at me.
It's like high school all over again.
Ugh. I would totally do
high school all over again.
-But that doesn't help you.
-No.
I got called into the administration office.
Ooh, look at my bad boy
getting called to the principal.
We don't have a principal,
there's a standing committee...
...that oversees the budget.
Ooh, look at my bad boy
answering questions nobody asked.
Look, you said
a few dumb things on the radio.
What's the worst that could happen?
I may get fired.
Well, even if you did,
you could get another job.
Yeah, who wouldn't wanna hire
the physicist who publicly said...
...physics is dead.
Well, I wouldn't put that under special skills.
I can fix it. I just need to write
a retraction I don't believe in.
Basically sell out to keep my job.
Great, I'll leave you to it.
Hmm....
Hmm.
Oy.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
LEONARD:
Sheldon, it's me.
-What?
-I know you're mad.
I have to write a statement that says
physics is close to a breakthrough.
Since you actually believe that,
I could really use your help.
-Sorry, I can't.
-Come on, don't be like that.
I can't because I think you were right.
-What?
-Look...
...not all science pans out.
We've been hoping supersymmetry
was true for decades...
...and finally we built
the Large Hadron Collider...
...which is supposed to prove it
by finding these new particles and it hasn't.
And maybe supersymmetry,
our last big idea, is simply wrong.
Well, that sounds awful.
Now I get why everyone hates me.
On the bright side,
after working together for 15 years...
...you finally get to hear me say
you were right.
Yeah, you did.
How's it feel?
Given I might be unemployed, bittersweet.
-Read it back to me.
-Hang on.
""Yes, one might question
the 20 billion dollars to build and run...
...the Large Hadron Collider,
but on the other hand....""
Okay. Um....
Oh, ""On the other hand,
contrary to predictions...
...the Collider didn't create
a small black hole...
...that devoured the earth
and life as we know it. So...
...money well spent.""
This is depressing.
Do you have any alcohol around here?
Not surprisingly,
when Penny moved out...
...she took every drop. Um....
Oh, but I do have several bottles...
...of Romulan ale that I bought at Comic-Con.
Isn't that just vodka with blue dye in it?
First physics, now Romulan ale.
What else would you like to defecate on?
I thought you were coming right back.
I was, but we're both depressed
and decided to drown our sorrows.
In mouthwash?
Man, that is so summer camp.
It's Romulan ale. From
Star Trek.
It was briefly legalized during the alliance
between the Romulan Empire...
...and the Federation
at the time of the Dominion War.
Aww, now I'm depressed.
The more I told him
about my lab, the pissier he got.
Know what he said to me? He said:
""I hope all your correlations
turn out to be specious.""
He said that to your face?
What a dick.
You know, you're a successful woman,
you should be able to brag...
...about your accomplishments.
So should you. I mean,
the guys are never shy about bragging.
Tell me about it. Howie texts me
every time his dog levels up in
Warcraft.
Has he ever called to tell you
he found three peanuts in one shell?
Because Sheldon has.
We should be able to do that too.
I guess we can brag to each other.
That's a great idea.
Damn right it is, I came up with it.
[CHUCKLES]
That felt good. Heh-heh.
There's so much money in pharmaceuticals,
we don't even wash out our test tubes.
We just throw them out and get new ones.
I just got a brand-new,
state-of-the-art fMRI machine.
Wow, those things are so expensive.
I know. Sometimes I just lie down in there
and take a nap.
It's like a million-dollar bunk bed.
At the office, I have two assistants.
I don't even know their names,
I just call them Thing One and Thing Two.
That's great. I don't have assistants.
Oh. I guess that's one of the benefits
of being in the private sector.
That and all the money I make.
Yeah, you've got that.
I've got my integrity.
Hard to say which is better
without making you feel bad.
Okay, so you guys are upset
because the collider thing...
...disproved your theories?
It's worse than that.
It hasn't found anything in years.
We don't know if we're right,
if we're wrong.
We don't know where to go next.
All I know is it looks like
I tongue-kissed
Avatar.
Come on, you guys are physicists.
Okay, you're always gonna be physicists.
And sure, sometimes the physics is hard...
...but isn't that what makes it boring?
-Hey.
-We're here.
What's going on?
Okay, as far as I can see,
science is dead because Leonard killed it.
And I don't know who the Romulans are,
but those guys know how to party. Heh.
-What do you want us to do?
-You're scientists.
-Cheer them up.
-Cheer them up?
Do you even know what a scientist is?
We don't need to be cheered up.
It just turns out that physics
is exactly like
Lost.
Started out great...
...and turns out just a big old waste of time.
Boo-hoo. You know what you sound like?
Babies.
Two whiny babies.
And there's nothing worse
than being stuck with two whiny babies.
Oh.
Oh, my God. I'm gonna have two babies.
No, no, no, babies are great.
You're lucky to have two babies.
I mean, look at me, I'm all alone.
I'm never gonna have babies.
Because you can't make a baby
watching Netflix with your dog.
Thanks for coming.
I may not make as much money,
but at least I know...
...that I'm doing something
that makes people's lives better.
Hey, my work makes people's lives better.
Especially if you have moderate
to severe eczema...
...and don't mind a few loose teeth.
You're right, we both do important work.
I map the structures of the brain
and you're trying to convince people...
...that itchy hair is a real thing.
It is a real thing.
It happens to be a side effect
of our cholesterol drug.
I'm just saying that my research
may actually change the world forever.
I hope it does,
because I'm gonna see that world...
...from a yacht so big
you can land a helicopter on it.
Physics is all we're cut out for.
I mean, If we weren't physicists,
what would we be?
I don't know, popular? Heh.
It's fine, I don't need to be
a theoretical physicist.
There's lots of things
I could use this brain for.
I could be an accountant for the mob.
I could guess people's weight at the fair.
Okay, this is getting silly.
Is it?
One-eighty.
Okay, that is enough.
Your lives are not wasted,
your careers are not at a dead end.
You hit a rough patch.
Instead of feeling sorry for yourselves,
you need to get inspired.
-How?
-I don't know.
When I'm feeling down, I go for a run.
Which is exactly why
I'm not 180 pounds, genius.
-I know where we need to go.
-Are we running there?
Because watching drunk Sheldon run
would be the highlight of my life.
We're going to see Richard Feynman.
Penny, Richard Feynman
is an iconic physicist--
I know who he is, Leonard dressed as him
for Halloween last year.
I had no idea Richard Feynman was dead.
Yeah. Most people don't know
he's actually buried right here in Altadena.
I'm sure they keep a lid on that
to avoid traffic jams.
Oh. Heh-heh. Here he is.
Oh, wow, he's buried with his wife.
We get it, a lady loved you, quit bragging.
Feynman was so cool.
When I was a kid
I'd put on some headphones...
...crank up one of his lectures and just...
...jam out to knowledge.
This guy knew how to live.
Taught himself musical instruments...
...he studied Portuguese
just to give a speech in Brazil.
The only part of me
that's been to Brazil is my bikini line.
Okay.
He did so much.
And here we are,
stuck and letting him down.
You know, Feynman used to say
he didn't do physics for the glory...
...or the awards, but just for the fun of it.
He's right.
Physics is only dead
when we stop being excited about it.
Even beyond the grave,
he's imparting wisdom.
Um, I'm the one who remembered it.
Give me the bottle. It might be corny...
...but I say we pour one out
for all the science homies...
-...who came before us.
-I love that.
LEONARD:
Do it.
Here comes some more.
[SHELDON VOMITS]
Eh, we got to see him run.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hi, you wanted to see me?
Yes, I wanted to talk about
the e-mail you sent me last night.
I sent you an e-mail?
You bet you did.
""Hello, shalom and aloha
from the grave of Richard Feynman.""
Oh, it's coming back to me.
""Please accept the following retraction:
I know I said physics is dead...
...but it is the opposite of dead.
If anything, it is undead, like a zombie.
Speaking of which,
if Richard Feynman came back as a zombie...
...I would totally let him bite me.""
Any chance that's the end?
""I got bit by a squirrel once.
I had to get rabies shots.
I cried so much.
My mother said, 'Don't be a baby.'
In conclusion, physics is great,
squirrels suck, and someday...
...I'm gonna put my mom
in a cheap nursing home.
Yours truly, XOXO
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.""
I can explain.
""P.S.
Can you come pick us up?
The Uber driver won't open the door
because Sheldon is covered in blue vomit."""
s12ep11.xml,"Champagne, a champagne,
a champagne
with a packet of Splenda in it.
You know what I call this drink?
A waste of champagne?
No. A Dr. Cooper.

He's
also
sweet and bubbly.
All right.
A... a toast
to Sheldon and Amy
and the publication
of your super-asymmetry paper.
We are so proud of you guys.
Cheers.
Thanks.
Yay. Boom.
Ooh! That is PhD-licious.
So, have you guys gotten
any feedback yet?
Well, there are
some comments online,
but we haven't read them.
We decided we don't care
what people say
about our work.
PENNY: Good for you.
People online
can be so mean.
I posted a picture of myself
on Instagram,
and some jerk said I looked
so skinny I might disappear.
And yet,
somehow she soldiers on.
Mm.
Although, Amy and I did
give the world a gift.
It would be nice to read
some of the thank-you notes.
I'm surprised you're interested
in some stranger's opinion.
Well, as I always say,
a stranger's just a friend
who hasn't complimented me yet.
AMY:
Okay.
I'll read them.
If any of them
accuse you of being too pretty,
Penny can help you through it.
Okay, here's one
from Dr. Saltzberg at UCLA.
Wait, no, stop.
I don't want to know.
What if he's mean?
Well, what if
he's complimentary?
I want to know.
Okay. He says...
I don't want to know.
All right,
just...
let me see it.
Okay, this is...
this is really positive.
Wow, it's,
like,
really
positive.
He says it might be
the discovery of the decade.
He's right.
They love it!
This is so exciting.

Hey, Penny and I
were thinking of getting
a big paintball game together.
(groans): Oh, Leonard,
why does she want
to shoot you?
She doesn't want to shoot me.
Who doesn't want to shoot you?
Penny.
No, that doesn't sound right.
She just wants
to play paintball.
It combines my love of whimsy
with her love
of making grown men cry.
Sounds fun.
Bernadette and I are in.
You don't need to ask her?
No. I've been pretty
annoying lately.
She's gonna want
to shoot me.
Dr. Cooper.
Ah, President Siebert.
What are you doing
in the regular cafeteria?
You're a superstar.
No offense, worker bees.
SIEBERT: You should join me
in my private dining room.
Dr. Fowler is already there.
Can I bring my friends?
No.
Can I bring my tater tots?
Yes.
All right, let's go.
Welcome to
the inner sanctum.
Oh, I do love
a good sanctum.
Sheldon, look at my fruit plate.
It's got kiwi on it.
Ugh. I don't like kiwi.
Neither do I, but it's so fancy.
Well, this is nice.
Why have we waited
so long to do this?
Because you
never invited us.
Ha-ha-ha!
Well, the important thing
is you're here now,
and we're so excited
about your work.
This paper's going to do
big things for all of us,
so if there's anything
that you need...
You know, actually, I could use
some barbecue sauce for my tots.
Oh, wait. No. Ketchup.
Can we have some barbecue
sauce and ketchup over here?
Both?
So this is how
the other half lives.
I just want you to know
that you have our full support,
and we're organizing
a big media push.
Articles.
Interviews.
Oh, you want us
to do interviews?
Well, we're thinking
a divide-and-conquer
approach here,
where you do the interviews,
and Sheldon stays here
and holds down the fort.
You know...
in case there's an emergency.
What kind of an emergency
would there be in physics?
I don't know, maybe there's
an object in motion
that won't stay in motion.
Or a reaction
that's equal but not opposite.
It sounds like
you don't want Sheldon
to do the interviews.
It's not that we don't want
Sheldon
to do the interviews,
it's just that we really
want
you
to do the interviews.
Without Sheldon.
(stammers)
Now, wait, wait,
are you trying
to exclude me?
Look, Sheldon,
you're a brilliant man,
but your people skills are...
This is not barbecue sauce!
This is steak sauce!
What are you trying to pull?
Like that.
This is ridiculous.
It is my work, too,
and I am perfectly capable
of keeping it together
for an interview.
Okay. Say somebody asks
if you feel your work
is derivative of the work
of Professor Joseph Polchinski.
Seriously, can we get
this man some barbecue sauce!?
Would you mind stocking these?
Actually, I'm not
on the clock today.
I'm just hanging out
with my boyfriend.
Ah, cool. Huh.
That's me, right?
Oh, I forgot to tell you--
I broke up with you,
and now I'm
dating... that guy.
I know you're joking,
but my flight-or-flight
response doesn't.
Isn't it fight-or-flight?
Not for me.
So I told my mom
she just needed to back off.
This is our wedding,
and if anyone's gonna design
the floral arrangements,
it's going to be my man.
Thank you.
I mean, I-I'm not trying
to be a groomzilla,
but... this is my special day.
(phone rings)
Someone texting you?
Uh, no. It's just my,
uh, doorbell camera.
Oh. I got one of those for my
place, but I never installed it.
Oh, it's easy.
I can do it for you.
You're gonna love it.
It's how I found out
a raccoon was stealing my
cheese-of-the-month club.
What did you do?
Nothing. I didn't
want to piss it off.
It was, like, huge from
eating all the cheese.
Hey. We're doing a big
paintball game on Saturday
if you two want to join.
Oh, my roommate asked me to
help her move out on Saturday.
Ugh. That sucks.
Sucks for her.
I'm playing paintball.
I-I didn't know
your roommate was moving out.
Yeah. I've been looking
for a new one,
but... so far no luck.
You hear that?
She needs a roommate.
(mumbling)
(mumbling)
What do you think, Stuart?
(mumbling):
Uh, i-i-it, uh...
Flight.
Flight.
That was hard to watch.
Yeah.
Okay, I need you to
be honest with me.
How do I look?
A little shorter, but as we age
that happens to all of us.
Come on, help me out here.
I've got a bunch
of interviews today.
Well, no one'll notice.
They never met you before.
Sheldon, I'm nervous,
and I wish you were
coming with me.
If it helps, I wrote up
some possible questions
and answers for you.
""Whom do you love more,
""Sheldon the scientist
or Sheldon the man?
""Answer: Sheldon
the scientist,
but by such a slim margin
that it's statistically
insignificant.""
Well, you really managed
to capture my voice.
Well, don't worry.
I'm sure you're gonna do great.
Thank you.
Okay, bye.
Wait-wait-wait.
You forgot the cards.
Love you, too.
Really? She asked you
to move in with her?
Yeah, she was
hinting around about it,
but I think I handled it
pretty well.
""Pretty well""?
You ran out of there so fast,
if it was a cartoon,
there would have been a
Stuart-shaped hole in the wall.
Was she mad?
Uh, no. I talked to her after.
She said she's fine.
Oh, no.
Yikes!
You'll find someone new.
(phone rings)
Everything okay?
Yeah, it's just
Anu's doorbell camera.
I helped her install it.
You can't look at it.
That's spying.
Who the hell is this guy?
Ooh, let me see.
He's got... bags.
He's probably
just delivering food.
Why is she hugging him?
Maybe she doesn't
have tip money?
W-Wait, why is she
inviting him into the house?
She's a good tipper?
Do you ever feel guilty
that we get to eat
in the fancy dining room
while our friends have to
eat in the regular one?
Yes. Wait, did you say
""guilty"" or ""happy""?
""Guilty.""
Oh, then no.
In fact, take a picture
of me with the garlic
knots to send them.
There's my MVP--
Most Valuable Physicist.
(chuckles):
Thank you.
And my star
of NPR
Science Friday
and a potpourri
of popular podcasts.
I don't know if I'd
use the word ""star.""
I would. I got an early look at
the interview you did for
Wired,
and it is glowing.
They loved you.
That's great.
Thanks for telling me.
Congratulations, Amy.
I'm so proud of you.
And that headline--
""The Neurobiologist
Who Revolutionized Physics.""
I'm sorry.
The who who did what to-- huh?
Oh, hey,
how did your interview go?
Okay, I guess.
You don't sound
very happy.
Oh, why wouldn't
she be happy?
She's the neurobiologist
who revolutionized physics.
Sorry.
This should be fun.
I've never played before.
Oh, fair warning-- it can
get pretty ugly out there.
Okay, well, remember,
I'm your fiancée.
(laughing):
Oh, I remember. Do you?
All right, we need two teams.
Who wants to be the captain?
Oh, me.
Uh, sure.
Why not?
All right, why don't
you pick first?
Okay, um... Leonard.
Yeah?
No, I'm picking you.
First? For a team?
What is happening?
All right,
I take Bernadette.
Really?
You're picking her over me?
Yeah, 'cause she's vicious
and can hide behind a mushroom.
Um... Sheldon.
PENNY:
Raj.
DENISE:
Amy.
PENNY:
I'll take Anu.
Howard.
All rightie.
Come on, pick me, pick me.
I will take... Stuart!
Yes!
Okay, guys, we
need some people
to stay here and
guard the flag
and some people to move out
and try to capture theirs.
Okay. Sheldon,
do you want to stay here and...?
What? Hold down the fort?
'Cause that's all I'm good for.
Is that what you
were going to say?
You know
that's not what he meant.
Oh, why don't
you go out there?
Maybe you'll be
the neurobiologist
who revolutionizes
paintball.
Stop it.
You're being ridiculous.
Am I? Maybe it's just
my poor people skills.
Oh, it's definitely
your poor people skills.
All right, the choices are--
get shot at
or stay here
and listen to them fight.
LEONARD and DENISE and WOLOWITZ:
Shot at.
(distant shooting)
(grunts, pants)
This is pretty exciting,
sneaking around like this.
Oh, so you like sneaking around.
Good to know.
What's that
supposed to mean?
Nothing. Never mind.
Let me see
if the coast is clear.
See anybody?
Yes, I saw a strange man going
into your house the other night!
What?
But out there,
there's nobody.
(panting)
Ow!
I'm hit.
(paintball shot)
Ow!
I said I was hit!
Sorry.
Ow!
Why do you keep shooting me?
Why don't you want
to move in with me?
I-I didn't say I didn't want to.
No, you just ran away.
Stuart?
Stuart?!
Did you run away again?
STUART
(in distance): No!
Bang, you're out.
What?! I'm not out.
You didn't even shoot me.
I'm not gonna shoot you
from right here.
It's too close.
It's gonna hurt.
Oh, come on. It's not
gonna hurt that bad.
I'm telling you, from
this distance it's gonna... Ow!
See? That hurt!
All right. Fine,
you can shoot me.
No, I'm not gonna shoot you.
Ow!
Ow! Ow!
Aah, you were right.
We're way too close.
See, I told you
it's gonna hurt...
Ow!
I can't believe
you're taking this out on me.
I was just trying to get
publicity for
our
paper.
By making it seem
like it was your idea?
I didn't write the headline,
Sheldon.
Did you even read the article?
Because I talk
about you continuously.
I know, and it just made you
sound modest and charming.
AMY:
Why can't you just
be proud of me?
I am proud of you.
Really?
Because you sound jealous.
Well, I'm that, too.
I've seen
Inside Out.
I know I can feel
two things at once.
Ow!
Ow!
Well, now I feel
three things.
Hey.
Who shot you?
Oh. Uh, oh...
Denise, uh, Denise, Denise,
Denise, Denise,
Denise, Denise, Denise,
Denise, Denise,
Denise, Denise
and me when I was running
from Denise.
What is up with you two?
Well, it's kind of
hard to explain. Uh,
you know when things
are going great, but you worry
that any minute
you might screw everything up?
No.
Yes.
If you really like her, you
can't let fear get in the way.
You have to move forward.
And at a certain point, the fear
of losing her goes away?
I will let you know.
You were spying on me?
That is not the point.
The point is who was that man?
Fine. That was
my ex-boyfriend.
Some of his stuff
was still at my house,
and he stopped by
to pick it up.
And did you give it to him?
Did you give him his stuff?
If ""stuff"" means
sex, then no.
If ""stuff"" means his
Waterpik, then yes!
I got the flag!
I'm gonna make a run for it.
Cover me!
So you're still talking
to your ex-boyfriend?
Yes, and I'm not gonna
apologize for that.
And you need to delete
that app from your phone.
Because you're hiding
something from me?
No, because you
should trust me!
How can I trust you?!
I barely even know you!
Then what are we doing?
Why are we planning
a wedding?
I don't know.
(paintball hits)
DENISE:
Aah,
sad man!
Ow!
Ha, ha! Oh. It's you.
I can't believe you shot me!
I can't believe I did, either.
Right in the chest.
Sorry. That's gonna
leave a bruise.
Yeah, a big one.
Does it hurt?
A little.
Want to kiss it
and make it better?
I do.
Where are you going?
Home.
Don't worry. I'll wave to
the doorbell when I get there.
Wait, wait, wait.
At least let me drive you.
That's okay. I'll Uber.
We can take you.
Come on, Sheldon.
Okay.
But I should warn you,
we're in a bit of a spat.
At least I think we are.
Amy, are we still in a spat?
Are you ready to apologize?
We are.
Aha!
WOLOWITZ:
Hey!
BERNADETTE:
Get out!
Sorry. Sorry.
I didn't see anything.
Actually, could I...?
Ooh, thank you!
Hey.
Wow. That's a lot of bruises.
Yeah, well,
you shot me a lot of times.
That's not even counting
the bruises on the inside.
'Cause I hurt your feelings?
Let's hope that's all it is.
Ah, look, I'm sorry
that I freaked out.
It's just that things are
going so good with us,
and I'm afraid that if we go
too fast, I am gonna mess it up.
I get that. I don't want
to mess things up, either.
(sighs)
Um, I got you something.
It's a key to my place
to show you that I'm serious.
Thank you.
Mm.
Well, isn't this technically
a key to Howard
and Bernadette's place?
Yes, so don't ever use it or
let them know that you have it.
Come here.
Oh. Uh, no.
I appreciate it, but
seriously, this is all bruise.
Kiss?
Gently.
Ow.
I'm about to start recording.
Are you guys ready?
Sheldon, are you ready?
Absolutely.
Great.
So, Dr. Cooper,
my first question is for you.
Oh, goody.
Would you say that your paper
is an extension
of the work
of Professor Joseph Polchinski?
I'll be in the car."
s12ep10.xml,"Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...
Actually, I-I need to talk to
both of you about your paper.
Oh, right, how are
the citations coming?
Um...
We came a-across
a-a Russian paper
that seems to disprove
super-asymmetry.
(screams)
Okay, Sheldon and Amy
are still pretty upset
about their theory
being disproved.
So we have made
a list of subjects
for everyone
to avoid.
Symmetry.
Asymmetry.
Uh,
SimCity--
sounds too much like symmetry.
LEONARD:
That also applies
to
The Simpsons,
Simba from
The Lion King,
and cymbals.
Russia or Russian
in any context.
The country, the dressing,
the roulette.
Uh, also no talk of
Rocky IV.
Why
Rocky IV?
Because he fights
a Russian.
I'm sorry about her.

We should just try and avoid
anything that makes them think
of their project

or Nobel Prizes
or successes or failures.

What are you doing?
Eating, reading,
watching television,
listening to the radio.
What does it look
like I'm doing?
Is that asparagus? I thought
you hate asparagus.
I thought so, too, but I also
thought super-asymmetry
was a good idea,
so what else am I wrong about?
Oh, so now you're
reevaluating
every opinion you've ever had?
Yes. I am following the example
of 17th century philosopher
René Descartes.
He subjected
all his beliefs
to radical doubt so that he
could build a bedrock belief
and build his cognitive life
back up on firm principles.
Ugh! Still yucky, still yucky.
(music stops)
Sheldon, I know you're upset
about the paper, okay.
I'm upset, too.
I mean, I was so sure
we were right.
Every fiber of my being
felt like this was it.
This was the one. How can I
trust my instincts anymore?
Well, just because
our theory was wrong,
that doesn't mean you're wrong
about everything.
Doesn't it? I've always thought
I hated jazz, maybe I was wrong.
Maybe it's great to hear
all the notes at once.
(music playing)
I'm trying,
I'm really trying!
What you eating?
Chicken fried steak.
What? You can't have
chicken fried steak
first thing in the morning.
Hey,
you knew I was a bad boy
when you married me.
Come on, you want
a piece of this?
You or the steak?
Me.
I'm not sharing the steak.
(knocking)
Hey, you guys busy?
No, what's going on?
I'm really worried
about Sheldon.
I've never seen him this down.
Have you tried making him
a cup of tea?
He's reevaluated tea.
Now he thinks it's nothing
but leaf soup.
That's a good point.
No, it's not.
No, it's not.
He's rethinking everything.
How long is it gonna be
before he gets to me?
Oh.
It's that bad, huh?
I'm afraid so. I just...
I don't know what to do.
I have something
that might help.
It's-it's a recording
of the only person
whose opinion Sheldon
actually respects.
Hawking?
Feynman?
No, himself.
It's a pep talk he made
when he was a kid.
He gave it to me years ago
and told me to save it
for a real emergency.
What?
You didn't break it out
when he declared his room
a sovereign nation
and waged a trade war
against us?
His major export is talking.
I didn't want that anyway.
Is that a VCR?
Yeah, Amy asked if we
had one she could borrow
and I just want to make sure
it still works.
What's on the tape?
Not sure. I used to record
a lot of
Jeopardy!
for my mom,
but if I push play
and you see some naked people...
Got it.
What is porn?
Ooh, we were looking
for ""vintage '80s erotica,""
but I'll accept it.
WOLOWITZ:
Hello, everybody.
I am The Great Howdini.
(coughing)
Put it back on.
You look adorable.
It's just a practice tape
from when I was trying to become
a member of the Magic Castle.
I didn't know
you auditioned there.
Oh, I never went
through with it.
I watched the tape and realized
I wasn't good enough.
You know that trick where
you saw a mannequin in half?
Don't you mean a lady?
Thank God it was not a lady.
I'd just be getting
out of jail.
Come on, you're
a good magician.
Really? You always
called magic dumb.
You can be good
at something dumb.
You know what, you should
audition now.
It's fine.
I don't need to be a member of
the most elite magical society
on the face
of the earth.
Sounds like you still want it.
And I don't want our kids
to watch this tape one day and
think their dad is a quitter.
Oh, we don't have to
show it to them.
Oh, I'm definitely
showing it to them.
Hey.
Hello.
""Fine with flags""?
Yes, flags--
up there flapping around
on poles.
If you think about it,
they're just the strippers
of the emblem world.
Well, I got something
that I think
might cheer you up.
It is the emergency pep talk
you made when you were a kid.
Oh, that.
I was saving it for the day they
stop making Star Wars movies.
I don't think that's
ever gonna happen.
How long has it been
since you've seen it?
Not since the day I recorded it.
No, I had just watched
Back to the Future II,
where Marty McFly gets a glimpse
of his future self
and that got me thinking,
the day may come
where I needed my help,
like they did with that movie.
That was not great.
Okay, all hooked up.
Here we go.
Oh, look how cute you were.
Amy please, of course I was
cute. Look how I turned out.
Hello, Sheldon.
Hello, Sheldon.
If you're watching this,
I assume something bad
has happened.
Something unfortunate
and unforeseen.
Something that's making you
question everything.
I'm so smart.
Now just to make sure
it's really you watching this
and not an imposter,
what am I thinking of?
On the count of three.
One, two, three.
Robot monkey butler.
Robot monkey butler.
Okay, good.
Should I leave
you two alone?
No, this is gonna be inspiring.
You should watch.
Sheldon, never forget,
no matter how bad things seem,
you can al...
What? What...
No. N... (scoffs)
My dad taped over it
with one of his stupid
high school football games.
Sorry.
You know, it doesn't matter,
nothing matters.
Is there anything
I can do?
Yes. You can build me
a time machine
so I can go back and tell my
younger self to give up, because
nothing's gonna work out
the way he wants.
I was thinking a nice cup
of leaf soup.
What's all this?
Your magic tricks
from the garage.
Your wands, your top hat
with the stuffed mouse inside.
I never had a stuffed mouse.
Okay, do not wear this hat.
Why is it all
in the living room?
Because I think
The Great Howdini
deserves to be a member
of the Magic Castle.
That's sweet, but I'm
not that guy anymore.
I've outgrown it.
Have you?
Look, I know you still
want this, and I can help you.
All those pageants
I did as a kid--
I could teach you
how to present yourself,
connect with the judges,
sabotage the competition.
Whoa, whoa, no one's
sabotaging anybody.
Of course not.
Little girls in ball gowns
trip, it happens.
Trust me, I'm gonna be
the pageant mom to you
that my mom was to me.
I thought you hated your mom
for making you do that.
More talk like that and
you're not getting any dinner.
Amazing how it all comes back.
(Skype ringing)
Yes?
Hello, Mother.
Hey, Beverly.
Hello, Leonard.
Hello, Penny.
To what do I owe this call?
I need your
professional advice.
Well, I'd love
to help you out, dear,
but I'm very busy at the moment.
Perhaps we can schedule
a time next week.
It's about Sheldon.
Oh, well, I-I suppose
I can spare a minute or two.
Wh-Why did you just say
you're too busy, but...
Leonard, please,
not everything is about you.
Penny, go on.
Well, ever since his
paper got disproven,
he's been a wreck.
He's been sad
and... and angry.
He just seems
kind of broken.
Well, it sounds
like he may be grieving.
Really?
Over a theory?
Of course.
You can grieve
over any emotional loss.
The more you care
about something,
the greater the trauma
of losing it.
Oh, boy.
He cared about this a lot.
Yeah. What can we do
to help him?
Well, grieving is a process.
Every culture has its own
rituals and traditions
to facilitate mourning.
The ancient Egyptians
had their mummification,
the Tibetans had
their sky funerals...
And when I was little and my dog
died, my mom sat me down
and very gently told me
that she wished the truck
had hit my dad instead.
I was trying
to lighten the mood.
Your dog had just died.
Howard and I have been working
really hard on his audition,
so it'll be helpful to get
another set of eyes on it.
Well, as someone who has
watched every episode
of
America's Got Talent,
I'm getting pretty good
at telling
when some American's got talent.
Seriously,
Heidi and I agree,
like, 90% of the time.
All right.
Don't be afraid to be
brutally honest.
Like my mom used to say
when I was doing pageants,
""Tears only make your eyes
sparkle brighter.""
That is both sad and true.
Half my Instagram
is after a good cry.
Howie, you ready?
WOLOWITZ (flat):
Yeah.
I now present The Great Howdini.
(music playing)
♪ I've got magic to do,
just for you ♪
♪ I've got miracle plays
to play ♪
♪ I've got parts to perform,

♪ Way. ♪
Hello. I'm The Great Howdini
from Altadena, California.
I have no brothers or sisters
and my favorite thing to eat
is grilled cheese.
When does the magic start?
It already started.
Hey.
Hi. How are
you guys doing?
A little better,
if you can believe it.
Sheldon?
(muffled):
Go away.
Buddy, come on, let us help you.
The only person
who could help me was erased
by the Medford High Wolves.
Oh, that's funny. My high
school was also the wolves.
No? Not now? Okay.
LEONARD: Look,
t-this might
seem strange, but, uh,
we thought it might help you get
some closure if you had a chance
to properly say good-bye
to your paper.
Yeah, you know, we
could say a few words,
you could talk about
what it meant to you
and-and we could
bury it somewhere.
You mean have a funeral
for our theory?
Yeah.
That's ridiculous.
I thought so, too, but my mom
thought it might work.
Beverly thought it would help?
We should try it.
Wha-- How come when you thought
it was my idea...
SHELDON:
(stammers) Leonard,
please, this is not about you.
I guess we could bury it
in the park.
Yeah, where dogs do their
business and other dogs
sniff that business?
I don't think so.
What would you
like to do, Sheldon?
The only fitting send-off:
a Viking funeral.
You mean, like,
push it out into a lake
and shoot it
with a flaming arrow?
This guy gets it.
How about a bathtub
and a match?
How about a bathtub
and a flaming arrow?
How about a bathtub, a match
and an ice-cold Yoo-hoo after?
Sold.
(sighs)
Would you like to say something?
Y-Yes, thank you.
I know this is just
a scientific theory,
but to me, it was
more than that.
It described the universe
in a new and beautiful way.
I want that to be the
universe we live in,
but I guess it's not.
Amy, would you like
to shoot the arrow?
It's kind of beautiful,
isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
It's getting kind of
close to the curtain.
It's in water, it's fine.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Looks like we both had theories
that were wrong.
PENNY: Okay...
Are you getting sick?
No, I have glitter in my nose.
Just your nose?
Consider yourself lucky.
Hey, I'm gonna
take tomorrow off
so we can spend the whole day
running the act.
You know what, it has been
so much fun working on this
with you, but...
But what?
It hasn't.
I'm not gonna audition.
Hey, I didn't raise a quitter.
You didn't raise me at all.
Look,
I get that you're scared, but
we just have to push past that.
I'm not scared.
I don't like the act.
It's over-the-top
and weird and has more
jazz hands than magic.
Why didn't you say
something earlier?
You seemed like
you were so happy,
and then when I tried
to say something,
you seemed like you were so mad.
Hey, this isn't about me.
I just wanted you
to have your dream,
and I wanted
to control everything
about how you looked and acted
so that your victory was mine.
Well, that's honest.
But if I'm gonna
go through with this,
I have to do it my own way.
I respect that,
and I'm glad that I helped
lead you to this moment.
Stop trying to make this
your victory!
(crowd cheering, whistle blowing
over TV)
Why are you watching that?
I'm just looking to see
if there's anything left
of your speech.
It's not important.
I remember everything I said.
And?
It was good, it just would've
meant more coming from me.
All right, bring it in.
Is that your dad?
It is.
I've only seen pictures of him.
I know we're down, by a lot.
And if I'm being
honest with you,
we're probably not
gonna win this one.
In fact, we're definitely not
gonna win this one.
Do you want me to turn it off?
But we're not
gonna quit, either.
And if we do lose,
you need to know
that doesn't make you losers.
You learn as much about who you
are and what you're made of
from failing as you do
from success.
Maybe more.
So you can spend the next half
feeling sorry for yourselves,
or you can get out there
and give them hell.
Yeah! Let's give them hell!
Oh-- watch your mouth,
your mom might...
I remember that game.
Did they win?
Oh, no.
No, they lost so bad,
the other team
let one of their cheerleaders
try to kick a field goal.
Well, that was a nice speech.
Too bad it didn't work.
Maybe it did.
What do you mean?
I've been acting
like the game is over,
but it's only halftime.
And there's a lot more physics
left to play.
Wow, was that your first ever
sports metaphor?
It was.
And I think it was a home run.
That's two.
It's interesting.
I've always thought that
my father's journey and my own
were so different, but he also
faced failure and setbacks.
Maybe our lives mirrored each
other more than I thought.
So, from one viewpoint,
you and your father's lives
are asymmetrical,
but from another vantage point,
they're symmetrical.
Sheldon,
what if symmetry and asymmetry
are observer-relative?
That would mean that
the Russian paper was right...
But only from one perspective.
If we look at it from a deeper
view in more dimensions,
our theory still stands.
Not only stands, i-it might be
an even bigger idea
than the one we were
originally proposing.
Go get your laptop.
We have a paper to fix.
(chuckles):
Okay.
Thanks, Dad.
We're gonna give them hell.
Hi, I'm The Great Howdini,
and it's an honor to be
auditioning at the Magic Castle.
Could I borrow your watch, sir?
Sure.
Thank you.
Ooh, Rolex, fancy.
I'll get it right back to you.
Observe:
one very expensive watch,
one wooden mallet.
Do I dare? I do.
Would you be amazed if your
watch survived that pounding?
I think you would-- behold."
s11ep3.xml,"Mm. Some news of our wedding.
I've sent you all a save-the-date e-mail.
-Ooh, exciting. You picked a date?
-Better, I picked 80 dates.
And I need you to save them all
until we narrow it down.
I thought we agreed on June 15th.
That's the day after Flag Day.
Everybody would be partied out.
It's a date, just pick one.
It's not just a date,
it's a textbook optimization problem.
There is a perfect date, just like
there's a perfect room temperature...
-...and a perfect dessert.
-Mm. There's no perfect dessert.
Yellow cake shaped like a dinosaur
with chocolate frosting...
...scoop of vanilla ice cream
on the side, not touching.
You'll see, you'll have it at our wedding.
You wanna bet?
Give me enough time,
I can do the same thing with a wedding date.
It needs to be on the weekend,
not near any of your birthdays...
-...or the weekend of Comic-Con.
-You could get married at Comic-Con.
ALL:
No.
We just need a weekend date
that's completely boring and uneventful.
Too bad you didn't get your ducks in a row,
because tonight would've been perfect.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I know today is Apple Jacks day,
but we're all out.
That's fine, I'll have anything.
-Really?
-Yeah, you know, whatev.
""Whatev""?
I like this side of you.
You know what I like?
Smooth jazz.
[PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE]
[HUMMING UPBEAT TUNE]
Hey, just a reminder,
I'm going out for drinks after work.
Great. Just a reminder, you're pregnant.
I'm not drinking,
just taking a new coworker out.
Ah. Just a reminder, you're married.
Female coworker.
She's new in town,
I want her to feel welcome.
And let her know the office is full of liars
before everyone tells her I'm mean.
Is she single?
I'm not setting her up with Raj.
What about Stuart?
Are you listening?
I want her to think I'm not mean.
Okay, it's just we have two single friends.
Howie, I just met this woman.
Why don't I wait and get to know her?
Maybe I won't like her...
...and then I'd be happy
to ruin her life with Stuart or Raj.
That's all I ask.
You guys lived with Sheldon a long time.
-A long time.
-So very long.
By the way, congratulations again
on your engagement.
Yeah, you got a good one.
Thanks. So it's strange,
Sheldon was talking in his sleep last night...
...and he seemed
like a totally different person.
He was relaxed and loose and calm.
Well, Sheldon's a complicated man.
He said, ""Whatev.""
Get him a brain scan, that might be a tumor.
I think the wedding planning
is really stressful for him...
...and that can trigger sleep talking.
Maybe this is a part
of Sheldon's personality he's been repressing.
I think we dream about things
we wish we could be in real life.
Really, what do you dream about?
Oh, uh, being the wife of Leonard.
Mostly that.
Hmm. I choose to believe you.
As much as we've studied the brain,
there's a lot we don't know...
...about dreams and their function.
Even psychologists are divided on it.
It's true.
Freud thought dreams were about sex,
Adler thought they were about dominance--
And again, mine are just
about being married to this little guy.
Okay, now it's just edging into mockery.
Well, moving to a new city
was a little scary, but the job seems great.
Everyone's really nice.
Oh, they are, super nice.
I mean, only one of them
took you out tonight, but it's not a competition.
Thanks again.
You know, we could've gone
somewhere more pregnancy-friendly.
Oh, it's okay.
One of the great things
about being pregnant...
...is drinking cranberry juice
out of a wine glass...
-...and watching people freak out.
-Heh.
Bernie.
Oh, damn.
Hey, what are the odds?
Yeah, seren-fricken-dipity.
-Hello. Rajesh.
-Stuart.
Hi, Ruchi.
Ruchi is my coworker,
but that was probably in your briefing packet.
Hey.
Hello.
What's wrong?
Well, I found the perfect wedding date.
-That's terrific.
-No, it's not.
It was May 19th, 1996.
We would've had a lovely wedding.
And our honeymoon would have coincided...
...with the first appearance
of the Hale-Bopp comet.
Sheldon, you were 16.
And in Texas,
no one would have batted an eye.
Oh, wait, it's no good.
It's the day Jon Pertwee,
the third Doctor Who, died.
And it's in the past.
I said it's no good, just let it go.
Sheldon, I appreciate you trying
to make this wedding perfect...
...but it's making you miserable.
The wedding isn't making me miserable,
the calendar is.
Why can't there just be one week
each month for famous people to die?
They've already arranged to die in threes,
what more do you want from them?
This is so frustrating.
Why can't I find the perfect date? I found
the perfect way to say hi to cowboys: tsk-tsk.
I'm just saying,
maybe there's a part of you, deep down...
...that wants to relax a little, you know.
Kick back. Say ""whatev.""
""Whatev""?
I'm sorry,
you're really not going to finish that word?
-I'm just trying to make a point--
-Finish the word, Amy.
Fine: ""er.""
Er, er, er.
Thank you, only now
you owe me three more ""whatevs.""
Ah, you were born in Trivandrum.
Have you been to the Kuthiramalika Palace?
No, I haven't.
Me either, what a small world.
Heh-heh.
I've also never been there.
I've never been lots of places.
Go on, quiz me.
Sorry, we're being rude talking about India.
Yeah, you know, if you and Bernadette
want to talk about America, that's cool with us.
Here, let me get you started.
[IN AMERICAN ACCENT]
Hamburgers, am I right?
So, what do you guys do?
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Well, I am an astrophysicist.
So if you ever go out at night
and look up at the stars...
...it's kind of my office.
He sells comic books to children.
Actually, I own my own store.
If you'd like to check it out sometime,
I'm running a new promotion:
Buy anything, get taken out
for a reasonably priced dinner.
Yeah, yeah, Stuart's struggling financially,
but he doesn't let that get him down.
He believes in himself...
...even though the whole world
has made it clear he should not.
Thank you. And you know, Raj...
...I think it's great that you no longer
live off your parents like a spoiled child.
You live over someone's garage,
like a failed adult.
Yeah, well, you live with her.
Oh, it's not like that.
He rents a room from me and my husband.
Who, by the way, is no prize either.
Oh, I don't care.
You know me, I just go with the flow.
Beach, public pool...
...they both sound awesome.
[ON RECORDING]
On second thought, beach.
I'd like to befriend a seagull.
That is crazy.
Yeah, will you e-mail that to me?
-Have you played this for him?
-No, I'm worried he'll say I violated his privacy.
Listen to how happy he sounds.
I'm up for anything, as long as I'm with you.
-What are you listening to?
-Nothing.
Oh, come on, I want to hear.
We don't need GPS,
let's just see where the road takes us.
I see why you turned it off.
That guy sounds like an idiot.
Honey, that's you.
Don't be silly.
My voice is deep and sonorous...
...like a Caucasian James Earl Jones.
""Luke, I am your father."" See?
It is you. I recorded you in your sleep.
Oh, look, a hitchhiker.
I bet he has some interesting stories.
-That's me?
-It's you.
So you spied on me in my sleep?
Sheldon, I'm sorry.
You've been doing this every night.
I couldn't help wonder
if it meant something.
-Well, it doesn't.
-Well, are you sure?
I mean, the prefrontal cortex
regulates impulse control.
So it's plausible that when we're asleep...
...aspects of our personality
that we repress might come out.
Don't try to put science lipstick
on your new-age pig.
For the record,
you make noises when you sleep...
...and I've never accused you
of repressing your inner chainsaw.
If you want me to object at your wedding,
just give me one of these:
This picture of Galactus eating a planet...
...looks like my prego wife
destroying a coffee cake.
Oh, yeah, I see it.
-I'm just saying, you should bow out.
-Why should I bow out?
Because we all know how this is gonna end.
That's what my doctor said too,
but I'm still here.
Okay, look, I think that she
and I have more in common.
Because you're Indian?
Just because she's brown, you get to date her?
Yes. And the next time we meet a woman
who's pale and cadaver-like, she's all yours.
Howard, Bernadette was there last night,
did she say anything when she got home?
Yeah, she said, ""Why'd you tell those idiots
where I was? Thanks a lot.""
How about we flip a coin?
Hang on, doesn't this girl get a word
in all this? And isn't that word ""no""?
Ruchi said she wanted to hang out
with both of us, why don't we just do that?
Fine. Let's hang out as friends
and see what happens.
If something grows out of it,
just worry about it then.
Also what my doctor said.
Hey, this isn't your laundry night.
I know. Laundry on a Wednesday.
It's the madness my life has become.
Why does this sleep-talking thing
bothering you anyway?
It's simple. I don't like the idea that my mind
may be keeping an entire personality from me.
Dr. Jekyll's other personality was Mr. Hyde.
Mr. Hyde didn't have
a postgraduate degree.
You know, is it possible that you're stressed
because you're scared about getting married?
I mean, it is a big change.
And you're not good with little changes.
That's nonsense.
You name one little change I was upset with.
Uh, when they changed the green Skittle
from lime to apple.
That is not the rainbow I grew up tasting.
Fine, let's start over.
Is it possible that the sleep talking...
...is a part of your brain
telling you everything's gonna be okay...
...and you just need to relax a little?
So...
...you're proposing
that the self is an illusion.
And that we actually
have multiple centers of consciousness...
...that are communicating with one another?
In laymen's terms, yeah.
Huh. Interesting.
So you don't believe there's a Cartesian self
that underlies the flux of experience?
Maybe in my twenties, not anymore.
Okay.
Well, assuming you're right,
what would you suggest I do?
I would start with something small,
see if it makes your life better.
Uh, you can learn to meditate,
take a yoga class.
You know, I have
always been intrigued by flip-flops...
...the official footwear
of the laid-back fellow.
Okay, sure.
If my feet are exposed,
I'll need to update my tetanus booster.
Oh, yeah. Makes sense.
And while I'm there, I might as well
get a flu shot and a mole check.
Sure. You know,
I've never had a mole check.
Ooh.
Well, it's been nice knowing you.
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
It's too bad Stuart couldn't make it.
He seemed fun.
Oh, yeah, he is. I love him dearly.
Not to say that I don't worry about him.
What's to worry about?
You know what, I'm talking out of school.
Speaking of which,
he's allowed to live near them now.
-Hey, guys.
-Oh, great, Stuart, you're here.
Yes, Stuart. Yeah,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.
Hmm. I believe that.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Sorry, guys, it's work, I've gotta take it.
I'm so glad you made it, Stuart.
Oh, yes, so glad.
I can't believe you went behind my back.
Which clearly means I want this more.
You wanna play a game
of Who's More Desperate with me?
Because you're
in the big leagues now, bucko.
Look, Ruchi and I are really hitting it off,
please let me just have this one.
I'm not going anywhere,
I'm like a fungus you can't get rid of.
Sorry. So, what's going on?
Oh, you just missed Stuart's funny story
about the fungus he can't get rid of.
Raj didn't tell me about tonight
so he could be alone with you.
Really? That's a little weird.
Just a little? Because I can work with that.
Look, guys, I'm not interested
in dating anyone right now.
I'm just looking to make some friends.
Yeah, I totally understand.
But if you were gonna date someone,
would it be me or Stuart?
I think I'm gonna go.
Uh-- Uh, Ruchi, I'm sorry. If you still want
to hang out as friends, I'd like that.
Thanks, Stuart. I'd like that too.
And the fungus is under the toenail.
-Hello.
-Hey.
So, um, I, uh....
I got flip-flops.
Good for you.
Oh, my God, what happened?
After I got the flip-flops,
I realized the tops of my feet were exposed...
...so I put on some sunscreen,
which caused my feet to become slippery.
And, predictably, one of them fell off
and went down a sewer grate.
Now, normally I would have walked away,
but this is a new, laid-back me.
So instead of getting upset,
I just reached down to grab it.
That's when I touched something furry...
...which I'm telling myself
was a damp toupee.
When the toupee licked my hand...
...I screamed and hopped down the street
on my remaining flip-flop.
Can I just ask--
No, this is a long story.
Why don't we save questions until the end?
So I finally came upon a bus bench,
where I sat and removed one of my shirts...
...and fashioned it into a makeshift shoe.
Yeah, not a waterproof shoe,
that is relevant to the next part of my story...
...the ankle-deep puddle
of warm apple juice.
Apple juice?
Maybe, maybe not.
I'm telling myself a lot of things, Amy.
What happened to your other flip-flop?
Oh, that involved what I'm telling myself
was a melted candy bar.
I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do to help?
Yes.
I want you to be in charge of our wedding.
Just, you tell me where and when,
and I will show up with a boutonniere...
...and close-toed shoes...
...and a
Star Trek
uniform
underneath my tuxedo.
That last part is non-negotiable.
Are you sure that's what you want?
As sure as I'm about to go bathe in Purell.
-I love you.
-I love you too.
You know, ever since I was a young girl...
...I've dreamed of a June wedding.
Maybe on a cliff,
overlooking the ocean at sunset.
Sure.
Sounds wonderful.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go clean up.
Pfft. Outdoor wedding.
I know what I'll be using that cliff for.
I call this meeting
of the Council of Sheldons to order.
Let's take roll.
Science Sheldon?
Present.
Texas Sheldon?
Howdy.
Fanboy Sheldon?
Greetings.
Germaphobe Sheldon?
Say it, don't spray it.
Where's Jock Sheldon?
Not the time, Humorous Sheldon!
Okay, new business.
Do we grant Laid-Back Sheldon
a seat on the council?
Hey, whatever you guys want.
I'm just chilling like Bob Dylan.
-Negative.
-Heck no.
I don't feel well.
[HONKS]
Can we kick him out too?"
s12ep12.xml,"Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...
So I told my mom
she just needed to back off.
This is our wedding,
and if anyone's gonna
design the floral arrangements,
it's going to be my man.
Thank you.
I mean, I-I'm not trying
to be a Groomzilla,
but... this is my specialty.
(phone chimes)
Everything okay?
Yeah, it's just
Anu's doorbell camera.
I helped her install it.
You can't look at it.
That's spying.
Who the hell is this guy?
Ooh, let me see.
So you're still talking
to your ex-boyfriend?
Yes, and I'm not gonna
apologize for that.
And you need to delete
that app from your phone.
Because you're hiding
something from me?
No, because you
should trust me!
How can I trust you?!
I barely even know you!
Then what are we doing?
I don't know.
Oh!
DENISE: Aah,
sad man!
This is so great.
Why don't we do it
more often?
Because you have two kids,
I have Sheldon,
and Penny's apparently
in the gym all the time,
'cause damn, look at her!
Yeah, so impressive
how you manage
to bounce back
after having no babies.
Ah, another reason why
we don't do this more often.
You've come
to a giant metal door.
I check the door
for traps.
There are no traps.
I use my wizard eye
to see what's on the
other side of the door.
Hey, that's sort of like how
you used a doorbell camera
to spy on your fiancée.
No, it's nothing like that.
Your wizard eye
reveals a monster.
Oh. Is it alone and unloved?
I guess.
I open the door and say,
""Hey, Raj.""
I have a bottle
of champagne for you.
Oh, we didn't order this.
It's from the gentleman
at the end of the bar.
Oh. Well, if we drink it,
does that mean
we're making a promise?
'Cause I am happily married,
although I will watch.
We're not gonna do anything.
Really?
So all that work's for Leonard?
Why don't you just
call her? I'm sure
you guys can work this out.
I don't want to talk about it.
Let's just play.
Okay, the cyclops tells you
that the enchantress
you seek is staying
at the Inn of the Dwarven Lords.
Really? An inn?
Anu is a concierge at a hotel.
That's a little insensitive,
don't you think?
I hadn't noticed that
before you mentioned it.
Well, now that I've
mentioned it, how do you feel?
Bad.
Shame on you.
Hey, ladies.
Zack!
Hi. You guys
know Zack.
BERNADETTE:
Yeah.
Of course.
Did-did you
send this over?
I did. I asked for the
most expensive one they have.
They said it was $200,
and I said
I want a
more
expensive one.
And then, they said it was $300.
But it-it was the same...
Don't.
Thank you, but you shouldn't
have spent so much.
Nah.
It's cool. I sold my company
for a boatload of money.
And then I bought a boat.
Then I got married.
Guess where.
On your boat?
No, but that would've
been awesome!
Well, congratulations.
Hey, you and Leonard
should come over and have
dinner with us on our boat.
Yeah, that would be so nice.
Leonard was just saying
how he was hoping to have dinner
with one of your ex-boyfriends
on his expensive boat.
Well, then this worked out
perfect!
Oh, yeah.

Hey. How was game night?
Oh, off the charts.
Literally.
Sheldon rolled a number so high,
it wasn't on any
of these charts.
(laughs) That's funny.
Wow. I should not have
driven home.
How was ladies' night?
It was fun. Amy got drunk
and kept telling us
that Sheldon's chest is smooth
like a porpoise.
Well, it does squeak
when you touch it.
And we ran into Zack.
Oh. Yeah? How's he doing?
He got married.
Oh. Well, that's nice.
Yeah, and he sold his company
for a fortune and retired.
Huh.
And you ended up with me,
so everybody wins.
Wait. You're not
jealous of Zack, are you?
What? Oh, absolutely not.
In fact, he should be jealous
of me because I have you.
Oh.
And a dungeon with over 30 rooms
left unexplored
because no one thought
to search for secret doors
under the wizard's throne.
Oh. You know, I'd
like to go exploring.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I'll get the dice
back out.
(phone chimes)
Go away, Raj!
What are you doing?
I'm winning you back
Love Actually
style.
I don't know what that means.
Really? You've never
seen
Love Actually?
If you want to watch it
right now, I'll just wait.
I have nothing to say to you.
Look, we both made mistakes.
I am so sorry that
I spied on you.
I didn't mean to, but
I know it was not okay.
Now, do you want
to apologize to me?
You also said you don't trust me
and that you barely know me.
I really thought this would be
more of a back-and-forth thing.
Honestly, Raj, why do you even
want to marry me?
You know, family
and India and stuff.
Here's what I think.
All of your friends are married,
and you don't want
to be left behind.
And honestly, that's not
a good enough reason.
Uh, okay, well, how
is that different
than what you're doing? Hmm?
Worried that you wasted
so many years dating the
wrong people, and now,
you're just looking
for a shortcut.
You're right.
It's not different.
Okay, so we agree.
Yeah.
Great.
Wait. What did we
just agree on?
That we shouldn't
see each other anymore.
You know what?
Why don't you shut the door,
and I'll just do the cards?
Uh, do you remember
Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack?
Leonard, I remember all
of Penny's ex-boyfriends.
If you'd like, I could
list them alphabetically.
No, thank you.
Fun fact.
You would think
Zack would be
the last one on the list,
but she also dated two Zekes.
Well, apparently,
Zack sold his company
for a ton of money and retired.
And that bothers you?
I don't know. I mean...
I guess so. Yeah.
It doesn't seem fair.
I work hard.
I'm really smart.
I've made substantial
contributions to my field.
But Zack gets to be rich,
while I'm still working
for a paycheck?
Well, a lot of people
you don't know are rich.
That doesn't seem to bother you.
Mark Zuckerberg,
Sultan of Brunei,
Gordon Letwin.
Who's that?
He's one of the first
11 employees of Microsoft.
Yeah, well, I don't
have to hang out
with Gordon Letwin.
Well, that's too bad.
He helped create
the HPFS file system.
Oh, the stories he could tell.
Penny told him we'd go have
dinner with him and his wife
on their stupid boat.
Well, just tell her
you don't want to go.
Well, then, she'll think
I'm being jealous and petty.
So you want to seem
mature and confident.
I make one mistake, and she says
she doesn't want to marry me.
Like she never
screwed up.
Did she?
Well, she agreed to marry me.
Honestly,
I think you dodged a bullet.
I don't think
she was right for you.
Howie, shh.
What?
You can't bad-mouth Anu.
They're gonna
get back together,
and you're gonna look
like a jerk.
I mean, remember
when we broke up, and Penny said
all those mean things about you?
What did she say?
I don't want to get into it.
Some of it was hurtful,
most of it was true.
So I'm just supposed
to lie to my friend?
I don't want you to lie to me.
No one's gonna lie to you.
(whispers):
Lie.
She says
the only reason I'm marrying her
is because
all my friends are married,
and I don't want
to feel left out.
Oh, that's nonsense.
No.
She's right.
(quietly):
Now what do I say?
So, Marissa, how
did you guys meet?
Oh, it's a pretty
funny story.
We met in a bookstore.
That
is
funny.
Yeah, I was just there
using the bathroom,
but this one had a stack
of books, like, this tall.
Oh. So, you really like to read?
Oh, no. I work there.
Yeah, she is super smart.
Seriously, you name,
like, any book,
she'll tell you if
she's heard of it.
Go on, try her.
Oh, uh, well, uh...
Catcher in the Rye.
Nope.
ZACK:
Look at that, Penny.
I guess we both like nerds.
So, uh, we gonna
take this thing out?
Nah. It's a little
choppy tonight.
Yeah, that's okay-- this is
nice, sitting under the stars.
It's actually kind of peaceful.
Well, it's a beautiful boat.
Thanks, man.
We love it.
Although, he's so tall
he bangs his head
almost every time
he goes downstairs.
After the first couple,
you don't even feel it.
Where are our manners?
Zack, let's get our guests
something to drink.
Oh, you got it, babe.
(quietly):
I can't believe
that guy's rich.
MARISSA:
Ooh, watch your head.
ZACK:
That was a close one.
Are you jealous?
I know, I know,
I shouldn't be.
He's super sweet.
I should be happy for them.
Oh, it's driving
me crazy, too.
Really?
Yes. I was trying
to pretend
like it wasn't so you
wouldn't think I was petty.
Wha-- turns out
we're both petty.
I love you so much.
Aw.
Cheers, guys.
Aw, thanks.
Thank you.
(laughs)
So listen, I got
to be honest.
We sort of have another reason
for asking you here.
We want to have a baby,
but we can't do it
on our own.
It could be
because of the game me and
my frat brothers used to play
where we kicked each other
in the balls over and over.
But the doc says
there's no telling.
We just don't know.
Huh.
You went to college.
And Zack's
always admired you
because you're
the smartest person he knows.
Okay, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa. You know, this
has been such a nice evening.
Let's all just stop before
anyone says any more things.
Leonard, would you be
the father of our baby?
Aw, you said a thing.
Wow, this is
really flattering.
And also really weird, right?
ZACK:
Oh, just to be clear,
you don't get to...
you know.
No, I...
I got it.
Just because I slept
with your wife doesn't mean
you get to sleep with mine.
We... we get it,
but... thank you
for saying it out loud.
You're welcome.
I know it's a big ask,
but it would mean so much to us.
ZACK:
Yeah, and we
really don't want
a stranger's, you know...
I know.
...sperm.
And Zack's always talked about
what a great guy Leonard is.
I...
(chuckles): I really
don't know what to say.
Really? You don't know
what to say?
You know, I-I think we
should talk about this.
Oh, yeah. Definitely,
you guys should talk, yeah.
Take your time.
He means privately.
Right. Sorry.
Sure. Yep.
Come on, Zack.
Okay. Yeah.
Okay.
You really think
those two should be parents?
There's nothing
wrong with them.
(loud thump)
ZACK: Ow!
(computer chiming)
Hello, Daddy.
Did you install a camera
to spy on your fiancée?
What?!
No!
That's what her parents told me
when they said they
were calling off the wedding.
But I told them you would never
do such a thing.
Thank you.
I mean, I did install a camera
and I did spy on her, but I did
not install it
to
spy on her.
Well, that's not going
to be
our
story.
Our story is that she's a liar.
And-and old.
An old, dirty liar.
Oh, no.
She's-she's actually great.
I'm the one who screwed up.
Well, don't say that to
them.
She's bad. You're good.
They have to pay me back
for my wedding deposits.
(sighs)
This is all my fault.
I should have...
I should have just trusted her.
So you're saying
you still want to get married?
Fine. Then I'll call her parents
and we'll straighten
this whole thing out.
I don't think
she wants to marry me.
And honestly...
she deserves someone better.
(sighs) Rajesh, you need to stop
being so hard on yourself.
You're a good man.
(chuckles):
Wow.
Y-You've never told me that.
You're also a dope.
That you've said.
But your heart's
in the right place,
and you deserve happiness.
So you just need to figure out
what you want,
and if that means cancelling the
wedding, we cancel the wedding.
Thank you.
But figure it out quickly,
or I'll be celebrating
my next birthday
with a lot more elephants
and marigolds than I expected.
And Leonard just stood
there with a big, dumb
smile on his face,
like he was watching a puppy
and a monkey make friends.
Well, I can see how he'd
be flattered to be asked.
It's not flattering.
It's creepy.
Well, something can be both
flattering
and
creepy.
You know, just the other night,
Sheldon said that my feet
looked like
Richard Feynman's hands.
Really? So
you'd be okay
if someone wanted to use Sheldon
as their sperm donor?
Oh, absolutely not. I am
the only handmaid in this tale.
So Leonard's
really considering this?
Yes. We got in a
huge fight about it.
He said, well, if I
don't want to have his baby,
then why shouldn't someone else
be able to? Do you believe that?
What?
Well, there is
a deep-seated biological drive
to pass on your genes.
It's only natural.
So you're on his side?
Well, viewing
Leonard as a mammal,
it's perfectly
understandable.
But viewing him
as your husband, he stinks.
And we hate him.
(video game weapons firing)
Really? Zack
wanted you to donate
your genetic material
for his baby?
Yeah. So I'd be helping out a
couple who really want a baby,
and they were gonna pay us,
and Penny freaked out about it.
That doesn't make
any sense.
I know.
They wanted
you?
(video game tires screeching,
car crashing)
Yes, Sheldon,
they wanted me.
I'm smart. I'm nice.
I'm smart. I'm nice.
And I can eat cheese
without clearing out a room.
Are you upset he
didn't ask you?
Of course not. I just
think it's interesting
that of all the people
he knows, he thinks
you're the best choice.
Well, he does.
I don't see why Penny
is so against this.
Well, perhaps Penny's worried
that you haven't considered
the emotional toll of knowing
there's a child out there
who is biologically yours
but not actually yours.
(video game tires screech)
Wow, that's
really insightful.
Yeah, I'm taller than you
and I don't have asthma.
Those people are crazy.
(phone chimes)
Come on, I know you're there,
and I know you know it's me.
(groans)
You're just making this harder.
Look...
you were right.
I was doing this for
the wrong reasons.
You deserve to marry
someone who knows
how amazing you are...
and who proposes
because he doesn't want to spend
a single day without you.
Not... not because he wants
to catch up to his friends.
Thank you.
And I want you to know, I
think I could be that man.
Raj, I'm not gonna marry you.
I'm not asking you to.
Then why are you here?
Because I like you.
Okay? I like you.
I-I like you enough
to start this relationship
at the beginning,
not in the middle.
So...
will you go out
on a date with me?
(sighs)
I don't know.
Okay.
But I warn you,
I just got out of
a weird relationship,
and I might complain
about my ex a lot.
Maybe he's being weird
because he doesn't know how
to ask for his ring back.
Hey.
Hi.
Where you been?
Just out.
All right, look, um...
I'm sorry that we fought before.
I know this is
a really unusual situation,
and if you don't want me
to do it, I won't.
Really?
Yeah.
We're a team.
We're in this together.
I'll be right back.
What is that?
It's a sample cup.
Really? 'Cause it looks like
the top off the NyQuil bottle.
It's the closest thing
I could find.
It's a gesture. Shut up.
All right, sorry.
So... are you saying
you're okay with this?
(sighs):
I don't know,
but... when I told you
I didn't want to have kids,
you didn't have a say
in that, so...
maybe I don't need
to have a say in this.
Thank you.
They couldn't have picked
a better person.
(chuckles)
Are you calling Zack?
No, Sheldon. Would you say
that last part one more time?
Oh, my..."
s11ep1.xml,"NARRATOR:
Previously on
The Big Bang Theory
:
I was offered a summer research fellowship
at Princeton.
A fine institution.
The place where Albert Einstein taught.
And where Leonard got his PhD,
so it may have gone downhill.
Gentlemen, you may remember Dr. Nowitzki.
She's back at Caltech for her post-doc.
-Hello.
RAJESH: Hi.
Question:
Are you seeking
a romantic relationship with me?
What if I were?
Well, that would raise a number of problems.
We're colleagues, I'm currently in a relation--
Amy? Amy? Amy?
Will you marry me?
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
One moment, please.
Really? You're gonna answer that right now?
Well, it's Leonard. I don't wanna be rude.
-Hello.
-Hey, where you been?
We've been calling you for hours.
Oh, I'm sorry,
my phone was on airplane mode.
-Why?
-Because I was on an airplane.
Hey, put him on speaker.
Hey, where are you?
I came to Princeton to see Amy.
It's a funny story, actually.
I was having lunch with Dr. Nowitzki,
and she kissed me.
-Excuse me?
-I'm sorry?
And in that moment...
...I realized that Amy was the only woman
I ever wanted to kiss for the rest of my life.
So I came to New Jersey
to ask her to marry me.
-Oh, that's so sweet.
-Oh-ho-ho.
Sheldon.
Although there was one man
whose blessing I needed first.
I've thought about it, and I really wanna
spend the rest of my life with Amy.
Do I have your blessing?
COMPUTER VOICE:
Well, Sheldon...
...I think you should make her finger
like Saturn, and put a ring on it.
You asked Stephen Hawking,
and not her father?
Stephen Hawking's a genius.
If he said no, I wasn't gonna
waste my time on her father.
But you did ask my father?
I did. He said yes.
Although not in a robot voice,
so it wasn't nearly as cool.
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you guys are engaged.
We're not engaged yet.
She's taking forever to answer.
Because you're on the phone.
We'll call you back.
[RINGING]
SHELDON:
She said yes.
-Congratulations.
-Mother, I have some good news to share--
-We're engaged. Heh.
I am so happy for you two,
but I'm not surprised.
I've been praying for this.
Well, God had nothing to do with it.
It happened because
I was kissing another woman.
And it made me realize
I wanted to be with Amy.
More than one woman was interested in you?
I might've prayed a little too hard.
And I wanna let you know right now
that we are not getting married in a church.
That's all right, Sheldon.
Anywhere Jesus is, is a church.
-Well, he won't be at our wedding.
-He's in my heart.
So if I'm there, he'll be there.
Then he's your plus-one.
You don't get to bring anyone else.
-That's fine. Love you.
-Love you too. Bye.
Lord, thank you.
Even though you can do anything,
that was mighty impressive.
We're engaged.
Oh, my God, that's amazing.
Uh, tell me everything.
Well, Dr. Nowitzki was kissing me--
You can stop leading
with that part of the story.
Congratulations, I'm so happy for you two.
Hold on, I have to tell Bernadette.
Hey, Bernie, guess what.
Sheldon and Amy got engaged.
-Can you believe it?
-Oh, my God.
I cannot believe it.
She's so happy, I think she's crying. Heh.
Think Sheldon's gonna want
some weird
Star Trek
wedding?
I don't know.
Well, Leonard could barely finish the words,
""
Dr. Who
wedding cake""...
...before I shut that down hard.
Mm-hm.
Are you listening to me?
Yeah, you're mean to Leonard. I heard you.
Is everything okay?
Look, I'm gonna tell you something,
but you can't freak out...
-...because I'm already freaking out.
-Oh, my God. What is it?
-I'm pregnant again.
-Wha--?
Interesting.
-Howard's gonna lose his mind.
-Wait, you haven't told him yet?
-No.
-So you told me first? Oh, Bernie.
This wasn't supposed to happen.
We were careful.
I didn't think you could...
-...get pregnant while breastfeeding.
-Well, guess what. You can.
Then, look, this is a good thing.
Halley's gonna have a little brother
or sister to play with.
-I guess that would be pretty cute.
-I was a surprise to my parents...
...and my dad said it was the best thing
that ever happened to them.
Okay. Maybe this baby actually is a blessing.
Oh, my God, honey, of course it is.
Heh.
-How am I pregnant again?
-Yeah, what were you thinking?
All right, I'm all checked in to my flight.
Well, I'm sad you're leaving.
Why'd you only book a flight for one day?
I came here to propose.
If you'd said no, I wouldn't want
to stick around looking at your stupid face.
Now, mind you, your face is only stupid
in the ""no"" version of the story.
But I said yes, so I get a lifetime of this.
Yes, you do, smart face.
Why don't you stay a few extra days?
Well, I don't have any other clothes.
-We'll get you some.
-I don't know, I'm pretty particular.
There's a comic book store
less than a mile from here.
Perfect, let's go shopping.
Oh, um, and I'm having dinner
with some colleagues tonight.
I'm sure they'd love to meet you.
-Eh....
-Come on. What do you say?
Aww. You're nagging me.
It's like we're already married.
-Is that a yes or a no?
-Gee, save some for the honeymoon.
Look at Nowitzki over there.
I can't believe she tried
to steal Sheldon from Amy.
You know what?
I'm gonna go there and tell her...
...that they're engaged now
and that her little plan didn't work.
Are you sticking up for Sheldon,
or still mad she rejected you?
Too far away. Can't hear you.
-Hello, Ramona.
-Hello.
Why are you sitting by yourself?
Oh, that's right, Sheldon's in New Jersey,
being engaged to Amy.
I heard.
Now that Sheldon's out of the picture...
...I could give you one more chance
to go out with me.
Nope, I'm good.
You sure?
I will not ask again.
I sincerely hope not.
Very well. I'm going to leave
before this gets awkward.
-Hey, want me to make dinner?
-Sure, but first why don't you have a seat?
There's something I need to show you.
Ooh. If it's how to make dinner,
that'd be great. Heh-heh.
Is this a pregnancy test?
Yes.
That means...
...positive?
Yes.
No. Heh.
-Yes.
-Heh. No. Heh.
Yes.
[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
No.
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
How could this even happen?
-I mean, we were careful.
-Well, it did.
-No. No. No.
-Yes. Yes. Yes.
Okay, okay, okay.
Well, what are we gonna do?
What do you mean?
We're gonna have another baby.
-No. No.
-Stop that.
-Yes.
-I'm trying!
Look, I know it's scary, but...
...we're both responsible adults.
We can do this.
You really think so?
No.
-Hey, Stuart.
-Oh. Hey, Raj.
-What can I help you with?
-I need to buy an engagement gift.
-Well, you came to the wrong place.
-Heh.
It's for Sheldon and Amy.
-No way. They're engaged?
-Yeah.
That's exciting news.
Who'd have thought Sheldon and Amy
would be the next two to tie the knot?
Tell me about it. I'm the one
who caught the bouquet...
...at Leonard and Penny's wedding.
Okay, uh, you know...
...they might like this.
Superman and Wonder Woman.
It's kind of romantic.
Hmm.
You know what?
Why am I buying them a gift?
They have love.
Screw them and their happiness.
What do you have for someone
who's bitter and alone?
Literally everything.
Sheldon, these are the heads
of my research team.
Dr. Zane, Dr. Harris, this is my fiancé,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
That's the first time I've said that,
and it kind of gave me the goose bumps.
Dr. Cooper, we are so excited to meet you.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
If you'd like, I could autograph
your menus after dinner.
-But I better not see those on eBay.
-Heh-heh.
No, no, no, we're just excited to meet the man
who landed this brilliant woman here.
Oh, that wasn't hard.
She threw herself at me.
Now, getting the universe to show me
its naughty bits, that took some doing.
Sheldon's a physicist.
-Oh.
-Oh, that's nice.
Amy, I recently read your paper on
lesions in the olfactory receptors in the brain.
It was inspired.
Oh, well, I guess it didn't stink.
And if it did, that rat wouldn't have known it.
[CHUCKLING]
I'm sorry, I'm sure you don't want to sit here
and listen to a bunch of work talk.
Oh, no, I love it. Let's talk about work.
Amy's work, my work.
Why don't we start with my work?
Actually, I do have a question for Dr. Cooper.
When Amy first told you about
her approach to synaptic tracing...
...did you think it was gonna
revolutionize the field?
Really?
That's your question?
What are you,
Entertainment Tonight?
You know, I'll give you a better question.
""Dr. Cooper, I heard you were working on
a top-secret project for the U.S. military.
Why don't you tell us about that?""
See, that's a great question.
Okay, what was that like?
Well, I can't tell you that. It's top-secret.
Boy, that was exhausting.
No offense, but your colleagues
were pretty rude.
-Really? They were rude?
-Yes.
They just kept talking about you
and how great you are.
No matter how many times I brought me up.
These are my colleagues
and they want to talk about my work.
Why does that bother you so much?
Because I was there.
It's like having Optimus Prime over to dinner
and not asking him to turn into a truck.
You know what, Sheldon? You're not always
the smartest person in every room.
You may not even be
the smartest person in this room.
Oh, I'm sorry, is Neil DeGrasse Tyson
hiding behind the couch?
Because if he is, he's not that smart.
It's pretty dusty back there.
-Where are you going?
-I'm storming off to my room.
Then where am I supposed to storm off to?
Well, you're so smart,
why don't you figure it out?
Is there another bedroom?
Perhaps a den?
So how are you guys doing
with all the new events in your womb?
You know, obviously, it was a surprise.
There was some crying and some yelling.
Some suggestion of make-up sex
that did not go over well...
...even though it's not like
we can get more pregnant.
But then we realized that it's a gift...
...in the sense that we didn't ask for it...
-...and we may not have chosen it--
-And we already have one.
You know, whenever I find a top I like...
...I always go back and get a second one
in a different color.
Which I hope is not the case with your baby.
I know you guys are freaked out,
but you're great parents...
...and if you ever need help,
we are here for you.
Yeah, anything at all. Just ask.
You know what you could do?
You could have a baby too.
I'm sorry, what?
That's a great idea.
We could go through it together.
Wouldn't that be fun?
Heh. You guys were just saying
how freaked out and miserable you are.
I say a lot of crazy things.
I'm pregnant and hormonal.
Do it. Have a baby. Do it.
Come on, it'd be so cute.
Our kids playing together.
What do you say? Why don't you two
hit the old mattress and whip up a family?
We're not gonna have a baby
just to make you guys feel better.
Yeah. If we're gonna have a baby,
it'll be when we are ready...
-...or when I'm certain Penny's gonna leave me.
-Exactly.
They're my friends,
and I should be happy for them.
And I'm trying...
...but all I feel is this gnawing,
empty sensation in my gut.
I had that once.
Turned out it was a tapeworm.
Cool. Uh....
It's just-- It's hard talking
to my other friends about this...
-...but I knew you'd understand.
-Why is that?
Because you and I are both alone.
Which is actually kind of comforting,
because at least we can be alone together.
Mm. This is-- This is awkward. I, um....
I was actually gonna close up
a little early tonight because I have a date.
-Really?
-Yeah.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Forgive me if I'm having trouble
being happy for you.
Don't be silly. I'm loving your pain.
Is this how our marriage is going to be?
Sometimes people will be more interested
in talking to her than to me?
COMPUTER VOICE:
Are you sitting in the bathroom?
Yes.
I needed a place to storm off to,
and it was all that was available.
Fine, but if I hear a flush,
this conversation is over.
But those people were
in the presence of a world-class mind.
And all they wanted to talk about
was their own nonsense.
Can you see the irony in that statement?
How about now?
How about now?
I'll wait.
Uh-- Surprise.
Oh, crap, is it our anniversary?
No. Wait.
-No.
-No. Okay.
-All right, so, what are we celebrating?
-Well....
Bernadette and Howard are pregnant again.
Amy and Sheldon are getting married.
-I didn't want you to feel left out.
-Oh....
Left out? Bernadette has
to grow a baby inside of her...
...and Amy has to marry one. My life is great.
-So do you not want the cake? I can--
-Try and take it away, see what happens.
Oh, crap, it is our anniversary.
Happy anniversary.
Amy.
There's something I need to say to you.
I'm listening.
I've been thinking about the Avengers.
I believe that.
I don't think that's something
you needed to say to me.
I realized that Iron Man is great.
And also that Captain America is great.
And sometimes Iron Man
is in a Captain America movie.
And he's not mad
it's not an Iron Man movie.
No, he can fly in,
give the audience a thrill, and then fly away.
And that should've been me tonight.
I should've been the delightful cameo
in your movie.
Thank you, Sheldon.
Instead, I was like the Hulk--
Okay, please,
stop talking about the Avengers.
Anyway....
I'm proud of you.
And I'm going to try to do a better job
of sharing the spotlight, because we're a team.
You know, much like...
...the Dodgers.
If they had superpowers.
And fought crime.
And Thor was in them.
Sheldon, I know this isn't easy...
...but you'll have a whole lifetime to practice.
It could take that long. I'm really bad at it.
You know, maybe, um...
...I should start right now...
...and go back to Pasadena,
and let you have this experience to yourself.
You wanna go back because that's
where everybody makes a fuss over you.
Your colleagues are right, you are brilliant.
-Hello.
HOWARD: Hey.
-Welcome back.
-Let me see the ring.
-Ooh, nice.
-Hey, hey, hey. Her eyes are up there.
Is that the woman who kissed Sheldon?
-Uh.... Could be.
-Hard to say. Tell us about Princeton.
-Excuse me for a minute.
-No, we'll catch up later.
This will be the biggest smackdown
since my Aunt Nupur showed up...
...at the family reunion
wearing the same sari as my cousin Shruti.
Dr. Nowitzki?
Oh. Dr. Fowler. Um....
Hello.
Thank you. Thank you so much."
s12ep13.xml,"Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
And this is:
Dr. Sheldon Cooper

Fun with Flags.
I'd like to start this episode
by apologizing on behalf
of Dr. Fowler, who made
the wild claim last week
that there was no national
tricolored flag
with a purple stripe,
when, in fact,
the Estonian governorate
inside the Russian Empire
had a purple stripe on their
flag from 1721 to 1917.
See? Right there
in the middle.
And I'd like to apologize
on behalf of Dr. Cooper
for having his zipper down
for the entire segment
on the flags of East Africa.
Sorry, Tanzania,
you deserve better.
All right, on today's episode,
we're gonna start
with some viewer e-mails.
Oh, take off your glasses
so people can't see
your password in
the reflection.
Oh, s-sure.
Okay, our first e-mail
is-- mm-- from...
uh, Brad or Brian?
I don't know, maybe it's Seth.
All right, put them back on.
Oh. Uh... oh, my gosh,
it's from Fermilab in Chicago.
Ah. Not surprising,
the Windy City.
Great flag town.
No, no, it's about our paper.
A team of physicists confirmed
super-asymmetry.
Our paper was right.
We did it.
We did it?
We did it.
We did it.
BOTH:
We did it!
We did it!
We did it!
Aw, remember when they only
did it on her birthday?

So, my incredible wife
has some exciting news.
Howie, stop.
I don't want to brag.
Oh, okay, sorry.
(clears throat)
Really? No one's gonna ask?
Sorry. What's your news?
The drug I've been working on
for the past five years
just got approved by the FDA.
Wow.
Oh, congratulations.
Was that the decongestant
you developed?
No, we had to rebrand that as
a solvent for mining equipment.
Is it that anti-itch cream you
were testing on grad students?
It's not, but that's
a really funny story
which I'm legally prevented
from telling you.
It's her
anti-inflammatory drug.
Oh.
Yep.
Three years of testing
and no reported side effects.
Ah, so it works.
Eh.
Well, congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.
Yeah, well, I'm happy for you,
because I want you
to head up my sales team.
Really? Me? Don't you want
someone with more experience?
Nope. The job's all yours.
(laughs)
Okay, well, thank you.
Why don't we just chat
about this at work?
We can chat about it all you
want, but you're doing it.
(chuckles)
We'll see.
That's a yes.
You guys will never believe
what just happened.
Yeah, we heard.
You did it.
We did do it.
And we didn't even
know we did it!
Wait, what?
Two physicists in Chicago
had to tell us.
Wait, what?
Their experiment on kaon decay
supported our predictions
on the higher order corrections
pertaining to super-asymmetry.
Wait, what?
I am so proud of you.
Well, I know how
to do the dishes.
Just, sometimes
I'm tired.
No, I-I mean, I'm proud of
how well you're doing at work.
Are you even using soap?
Do you want to do this?
Yeah, I really do.
You know, it was nice
of Bernadette to offer,
but I'm not sure it's
the right move for me.
Well, what are you
talking about?
If you were in charge
of her project,
wouldn't that
be a promotion?
Well, yeah, but it's not
the most important thing.
Aren't you always saying
it's about the work,
not more money
or a better title?
All the smart things I say,
and you remember the dumb one.
Plus, I'd be working
for Bernadette.
I don't know
if that's a good idea.
Look, I-I know she
can be difficult,
but she's no match for you.
Whatever she dishes out, you
can give it right back double.
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?
There you go.
(intercom beeps)
RECEPTIONIST:
President Siebert,
I have Dr. Cooper
and Dr. Fowler for you.
Great.
You two.
Bring it in.
(stammers) What are
we bringing in?
A hug.
Oh. No, I don't want to.
Well, what you don't want,
you don't get.
Come on. Sit.
I hope you know, with these
new data supporting your theory,
we could be looking
at a Nobel-winning achievement.
And by ""we,""
you mean ""we,""
not ""we.""
""We,"" ""we,"" whatever.
Whee!
Just a heads-up.
Doctors Pemberton and Campbell
from Fermilab
are flying to Los Angeles,
and they are eager to meet you.
Confirming my theory,
eager to meet me.
They are checking
all my boxes.
You know,
Caltech has 38 Nobel laureates.
If you win, you and Amy
will be 39 and 40.
Ooh! Dibs on 39.
What's the difference?
Wha... You are right,
there is no difference at all.
Thank you. It is exciting.
Oh, that's very sweet.
I'm gonna remember
you said that.
Just like I remember how
you tried to take my office
when I was on maternity leave.
(laughs)
Of course I'm not angry.
Bye-bye.
How can I be angry
at a dead man?
Hey, you got a sec?
Sure. What's up?
Uh, bad news.
I spoke to my supervisor
about heading up
your sales team, and she said
she just can't
lose me right now.
Do you want me to call her?
I could rip her a new one.
No, no. No ripping.
Um, anyway, I-I don't want
to leave her shorthanded,
so I'm sorry.
I respect that.
That's what makes you
a good employee.
Oh, thank you.
It's just such a bummer.
I know. Just, ugh!
You sure you don't want me
to call her?
Oh, no, I'm sure, definitely
sure. Don't call her.
But, you know, just, ugh, why?
The last time we were in this
room, we were getting married.
I remember.
It's a lot less
impressive
without
Mark Hamill in it.
That's what you said
about our honeymoon.
And I stand by it.
Doctors Cooper and Fowler,
these are Doctors Pemberton
and Campbell,
whose experiment
confirmed your work.
Hello. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. Hi.
Okay, I'll leave you all to it.
Remember about
the hugging.
It is such a pleasure
to meet you.
Oh, it's really nice
to meet you, too.
I mean, we thought we'd
have to wait decades
to get confirmation
for our theory.
Yes, thanks to you,
I'll get to eat my Nobel dinner
with my original teeth.
Well, this certainly is a thrill
for us. Lunch with you two,
and, uh, tomorrow, we're gonna
see a taping of
Ellen.
She's having John Stamos on.
Uncle Jesse!
Sounds fun.
So, um, listen, we just
published a few months ago.
How did you have time to
design an experiment?
We didn't. This whole thing
is actually a gigantic accident.
CAMPBELL: Yeah, we've been
working with kaons,
and our data made
absolutely no sense.
A few weeks ago, someone
told us about your paper,
and we realized
that our failed experiment
confirmed your theory.
And now,
instead of losing our jobs,
Fermilab flew us to L.A.
Economy Plus.
Free headphones.
Looks like my wife left me
a month too soon.
(laughs)
(stammers) So you weren't even
thinking about super-asymmetry?
Thinking about it?
(chuckles)
We don't even
understand it.
(both laugh)
PEMBERTON: And
now look at
the four of us,
changing the face of physics!
Ooh, I got to do it.
Oh, man, that last episode of
Star Trek: Discovery
was crazy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I-I'm actually one behind.
I haven't started
the new season yet.
Ooh, uh, how about
this week's
Walking Dead?
Two behind.
Three behind.
Black Mirror?
No.
No.
Come on, there must be
something we've all seen.
Oh, how about that video
of my dog I sent you,
where she's growling
at a pinecone?
I actually hadn't
watched it yet,
but thanks
for ruining the ending.
Uh, can you believe this?
Doctors Pemberton and Campbell
have been doing a press tour
trying to take credit
for super-asymmetry.
They didn't even know
what they were finding.
So what? I mean, no one's
gonna give them credit
for accidentally
discovering something.
WOLOWITZ:
Yeah, who remembers the guy
who was trying to find India
and discovered America instead?
What was his name again?
(chuckles)
But this is different.
Sheldon, super-asymmetry
is your paper.
Everyone knows
you were there first.
Mm, actually, the Nobel
Committee has sometimes favored
experimentalists like them
over theoreticians like you.
No, that's just
a scary campfire story
like the guy with the hook.
No, i-it's true.
The scientists
that proved the big bang,
they thought their sensors
needed cleaning
until someone pointed out
that they were picking up
cosmic background radiation
from the singularity.
They won the Nobel.
Not the scientists
that came up with the theory.
So you're saying they could
steal our Nobel Prize?
Yes.
That's terrible.
Good news, though:
Now we have something
we can talk about.
Hey, you wanted
to see me?
Yeah, come on in.
Okay.
Close the door.
Okay.
Have a seat.
Do I have to?
You really do.
So, I talked
to your supervisor,
and she said that she
never stopped you
from working on my team,
because you never asked her.
Really?
Oh, you know, you should know,
she's been taking
our new antidepressant,
and lying is one
of the main side effects.
Why don't you want
to work with me?
I know I can be tough,
but that's just 'cause
I'm surrounded by
useless idiots.
No, it's not that.
Then why?
Honestly, I don't know
if I'm up to it.
You know,
the last project I managed
was my high school yearbook.
And?
And that was the year
we didn't have one.
Apparently, the printers
won't make them
without getting paid.
What happened to the money?
Uh, if I didn't know then,
I'm not gonna magically
know now.
Plus, you know,
I didn't go to college.
I'd be in charge of people
that are far more educated
with more experience;
what if they don't listen to me?
Then you be really mean to them.
Have I taught you nothing?
Penny, everybody
feels like you do.
Like they're not good enough,
not smart enough.
What, even you?
Of course.
Dr. Rostenkowski,
you wanted me...
Hey, did they not teach
knocking at Stanford? Get out!
(chuckles) I love that kid.
There you are.
Dr. Cooper, hello.
Hello to you, too. Now stop
trying to steal our Nobel Prize.
You come up with your own idea.
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
Wouldn't that
be something, though?
Well, too bad.
This discovery belongs
to Amy and me.
(sighs)
Look, Dr. Cooper, we all
want a Nobel Prize.
Super-asymmetry could be the
breakthrough that gets us there.
But we can't fight over credit;
we have to work together.
So...
you're saying
that the four of us
should just agree
to share this discovery?
Well, no,
unfortunately,
only three people
can share a Nobel.
Oh, that's right.
So he's out?
No, I'm not out.
So he's out?
Neither of us is out.
We think that
the three physicists
should be the ones to win
the Nobel Prize for physics.
Wait, so you want
to cut Amy out?
No, of course not.
We don't want to,
but we're going to.
But she's my wife.
Yes, exactly,
she's your wife.
And she's a neuroscientist.
It's like, what's she
even doing on this paper?
It just raises questions.
Look, Fermilab
is going to recommend
the three of us
to the Nobel Committee.
The best chance we have is if
your university does the same.
I see.
So you really think that
I'm the kind of man who would
sell out his partner
for the chance
of winning a Nobel Prize?
Are you?
Boy, I hope not.
I can't believe
Penny doesn't want
to head up my
sales team.
That's too bad.
But it's her decision,
not yours.
Do you hear how dumb you sound?
Why does this matter
to you so much?
Because I believe in her,
and I make people better.
It's what I do.
Against their will?
It's no fun if they want to.
That's just called watching.
Look at Howard.
He was a disaster
when I met him.
Now he's a foxy astronaut
with a hot wife.
Wait, he always wanted
to be an astronaut.
He thinks that, too.
That's how good I am.
Wait, so what
are you gonna do?
Just badger her
until she says yes?
Mm, that may have worked on you,
but she's too smart for that.
Well, if you like fixing people,
I could use some help.
Raj.
Why do you think you stopped
wearing Crocs and socks?
Uh, well, one day I just woke up
and realized they looked silly.
Yes, you did.
All on your own.
(whispering):
That's how good I am.
(clucking tongue)
What's wrong?
Why do you assume
something's wrong?
Because you haven't
touched your dinner,
and you're literally ticking
like a bomb about to go off.
Oh, Amy.
You see through me
like one of Penny's shirts.
Just tell me.
I talked to Doctors Pemberton
and Campbell today.
They reminded me that only three
people can share a Nobel Prize.
Their university
is recommending
the two of them and me.
And they want Caltech
to do the same.
Oh.
They say, if we present
a united front,
we have a much better shot
at winning.
Well, you know,
that makes sense.
Oh, but don't worry.
I won't do that to you.
Maybe you should.
What?
This has been
your lifelong dream.
And you may not get
another chance.
I don't want to be the reason
that you don't win a Nobel.
You're the only
reason I deserve one.
But if your best shot
is with them,
I think you should take it.
Is this really
what you want me to do?
I just want you to be happy.
Thank you.
(clicking tongue)
Hey. How long have you
been sitting there?
Long enough for two
of your neighbors to ask
if I was lost
and looking for my mother.
I'm not changing my mind,
Bernie.
That's okay. I'm sorry.
It was wrong of me to badger you
into doing something
that made you uncomfortable.
Thank you.
Mm, it's probably
for the best.
I need someone
who's strong and confident
to head up my sales team,
so I'm giving it to Karen.
What... Karen?
Well, what's the job?
Eating my yogurt and
then lying about it?
I'm just saying.
She went to college.
She's really smart.
Well, I'm smarter than Karen.
I can read the word ""Penny""
on a cup of yogurt.
Why are you getting so upset?
I'm agreeing with you.
This is a big job,
and I need someone
who's up to it.
I am up to it.
I'm just nervous about it.
I know.
And that's why
I don't want to pressure you
into doing something that you
clearly don't want to do.
I know what you're up to.
Is it working?
Yes.
So I'll see you
Monday morning?
Yes.
I bet I can make
that girl president.
(intercom beeps)
RECEPTIONIST:
Uh, President Siebert,
Dr. Cooper is...
I need to talk to
you about the paper
that Dr. Fowler
and I published.
Send him in.
Amy and I did this together,
and I will not
be part of an award
that does not recognize
the value of her contributions.
So you either include both of us
in the recommendation letter,
or don't bother writing one.
I hope you know
that's going to cause a fight
between us
and the Fermilab team.
If it's a fight that doesn't
involve any touching,
risk of physical harm
or uncomfortable eye contact
'cause it's happening online
or through intermediaries,
I say bring it.
All right.
I respect your decision.
You do?
Yes. You and Dr. Fowler
have my full support.
Oh, okay.
I anticipated
a little more pushback.
Sorry, my job here
is to serve your needs,
both academic and personal.
Huh.
Well, now I'm filled with
all this nervous energy.
I don't know quite
what to do with it.
We have a fully equipped
gymnasium.
Yeah... Really?
Where's that?
It's part of the new
sports complex.
Oh.
And where is that?
Come on, I'll show you.
Are there monkey bars?
All right, now,
I'm sure some of you
are wondering,
""Who is this woman?
""How did she get to be
in charge of the sales team?
Is it because she's friends
with Dr. Rostenkowski?""
Because she is.
""Is it because she was
Miss Cornhusker 2001
and still fits
in those very same jeans?""
'Cause she was, and she does,
and they're actually
a little baggy.
Or is it because she's
the best damn salesperson here?
Because I am.
Now that we're clear on that,
here are the drug specs
and marketing strategy
for Inflamminex.
Which, now that I say it out
loud, might be a placeholder.
By tomorrow, I want everyone to
have this committed to memory.
Do you have it
committed to memory?
You want to have
a contest, Karen?
Winner gets a yogurt.
No, boss.
All right, now we all know
what we need to do.
Let's go do it.
R-Right now.
Get out of here. Go.
That was
really impressive.
Damn right it
was impressive.
Okay, that tone
doesn't work with me.
Sorry, boss."

""How did she get to be in charge
of the sales team?
Is it because she's friends
with Dr. Rostenkowski?""
Because she is.
""Is it because she was
Miss Cornhusker 2001
and still fits
in those very same jeans?""
Because she was, and she does
and they're actually
a little baggy.
""And the absence of side effects
means that Inflaminex
""can be taken in conjunction
with other medications.
It's a brand-new day.""
(exhales)
Such a good tagline, I forgot,
who came up with that?
You did.
That's right, I did.
Okay, I know it's late
and I've been
working you guys really hard,
so I have a little treat
for you.
We get to go home?
No.
You get to stay here
and get vitamin B12 shots.
(team members groan)
Oh, my God.
You guys are still here?
We're happy to be here.
It's a brand-new day.
It's 12:15, it's literally
a brand-new day.
Everybody go home.
(scoffs)
All right, fine.
Go, get out of here.
Go on. (sighs)
I think things
are going pretty good.
Are you aware that Dave's
in the break room crying?
Yeah, I told him
if he's gonna be a crybaby,
go to the break room.
I just really want
to be prepared
for this conference.
You're gonna
do great.
You really think so?
Of course;
they're scared of you,
you're scared of me--
The system works.

Okay, Howie,
I'm going.
Have a great conference.
Thanks.
Remember, I'm leaving
you with two babies.
I expect to see two
babies when I get back,
and they better be the same
two babies because I'll know.
I think I'm capable
of babysitting.
Don't call it babysitting;
they're your children.
It's called parenting.
What's the difference?
You don't get paid.
Now, the emergency
contacts are on the fridge
and I left money for
food on the table.
Oh, sounds like I do get paid.
(chuckles)
Don't worry.
I got this covered.
I know you do.
Quick question,
where are the kids right now?
They're upstairs.
They're at daycare.
They're at daycare?
They're upstairs!
Why are you
messing with me?!
(clears throat)
Wow. That's a lot of
luggage for a weekend.
(groans)
I know.
I didn't know what to wear,
so I brought a few options.
Was one of the options the
option to never come back?
(sighs)
(chuckles) I just really want
this weekend to go well.
Doesn't answer my
question, but okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Thanks.
And you're gonna do great.
Just relax, stay out of your
head, and try to enjoy it.
Aw. That reminds me
of what I said to you
the first time
we slept together.
I still use it.
It's a mantra.
Yeah.
Oh, thank goodness!
I caught you before you left.
I'm just going
for the weekend.
Just the weekend.
You all heard her say it.
So, your convention
is in San Diego, right?
Yes.
Great. I need you to settle
a bet for Amy and me.
I say,
when it's not Comic-Con,
no one will be dressed
as superheroes.
Mm-hmm.
And I say fewer people will
be dressed as superheroes
but still some.
A crazy person in a cape
doesn't count.
Mm, why not?
It counts at Comic-Con.
Also, if you get a chance
to sneak into Hall H,
last year, I left my neck
pillow under my seat.
Uh, third row,
second from the aisle.
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.
At least there will be
one superhero in San Diego.
So, Leonard, what are you
gonna do while Penny's away?
I don't know.
Maybe watch a movie
with subtitles.
If you're looking for
something outside the norm,
I have invented
a new chess variant
where the bishops can
also move like knights.
What do you call that,
Bishops Be Crazy?
First of all,
it would be
""Bishops
Are
Crazy.""
Not if you're being crazy.
Checkmate.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Hello.
Where are the kids?
I thought they were with you.
What? No! I...
I'm kidding.
They're at daycare.
(chuckles)
What about me makes you think
my heart can handle that joke?
Hey.
You guys want to come hang out
at my place this weekend?
So we can help you babysit?
Uh, it's not babysitting.
They're my children.
They're not our children.
Oh. Well, for you guys,
then, it is babysitting.
No offense,
Howard,
but I don't want
to spend my weekend
around your loud, sticky babies.
You can't insult my
kids. I
am
offended.
N-No, you can't be.
I said ""no offense.""
That's like ""no backsies""
but for offense.
What do you say? We'll
play some board games.
It'll be like a party.
Three guys playing a board game
doesn't sound
like much of a party.
(chuckles) Someone doesn't
remember college very well.
As opposed to the leading
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory,
our product
greatly reduces
the risk of ulcers.
So it won't burn a hole
in your stomach. (chuckles)
And it won't burn a hole
in your wallet, either!
Okay.
(chuckles)
I got this.
(chuckles)
Thank you for stopping by.
It's a brand-new day!
See? You're doing great.
Yeah.
Mediocre actress,
great drug pusher.
Who knew?
Inflaminex, huh?
So what can you
tell me about it?
Well, we...
Oh, don't waste your time.
His name is Danny. He works for
one of the other drug companies.
Hey, nothing wrong with
checking out the competition.
Aw, we don't see you
as competition.
You should.
Our anti-inflammatory is hitting
the market this year, too.
Well, ours has zero
drug interaction risk.
Yeah. So does an Altoid.
Speaking of Altoids,
why don't you go get one?
(chuckles):
Okay.
Let's everyone calm down.
If you can't find
a pill for that here,
then you're not trying
hard enough.
It's all right.
I'll go.
I don't know what
it is about that guy,
but he just gets
on my nerves.
Well, you scared
the bad man away.
Who's a good girl?
They're still asleep.
Apparently, when
I put someone down for a nap,
they sleep hard.
That's a weird brag, Howard.
(doorbell rings)
I'll get it.
Bernadette thinks I have poor
parenting skills. (chuckles)
Maybe she's basing that
on your poor husbanding skills.
Who can say?
I'm bad at a lot of things.
Hello.
Hi.
Hey. I didn't think
you were coming.
Um, I changed my mind.
I thought it'd be fun to spend
some time with your children.
Where are the
little scamps?
""Scamps""?
I'm sorry.
Tykes. Rug rats.
What is the PC
term these days?
What's going on?
We were in the bookstore,
and I found this.
Experimenting
with Babies:
50 Amazing Science Projects
You Can Perform on Your Kid.
You can't experiment
on his kids.
Yeah, you're
not their father.
You can't experiment on my kids.
(sighs) Fine. Can I at least
play a game with them?
Perhaps...
How Developed
is Your Peripheral Vision?
Mine's great.
I saw that.
You know, these experiments
are pretty harmless.
There's one where you just put
the baby in front of a mirror
and you watch them
watch themselves.
That sounds adorable.
Let me see.
How come when she talks
about experiments on babies,
you think it's adorable,
but when I do it,
everyone gets upset?
I think I can speak
for all of us.
You're just creepy.
No offense.
Hey, this one we can do
with both Michael and Halley.
It's called Grabby Hands.
Wasn't that your nickname
in high school?
No, it was Mama's Boy.
But the joke was on them,
because I love my mom.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Guys, listen,
you secure them both
in car seats
and slowly spin a toy
at the end of the
string above them.
The younger baby
tends to reach
with either hand,
and the older baby prefers
the dominant hand.
That is kind of interesting.
And it's not really
experimenting
on
the kids.
It's more like experimenting
with the kids.
AMY: Well, I guess
if you think about it,
it's kind of like
playing games with them.
WOLOWITZ:
Okay, you know what,
when they wake up,
we can try one or two of these.
(gasps)
Yay!
(loudly):
I said, ""Yay!""
Thank you.
It's a brand-new day.
Wow, we got
a pretty good crowd here.
I know. But not
as big as that booth.
What's going on
over there?
Yeah, that's Chantix.
Ray Liotta's signing
autographs until 2:00.
(phone ringing)
Hey, I thought we weren't
supposed to have our phones
in the booth.
That's a ""you"" rule,
not a ""me"" rule.
Hey, can I help you?
Actually, I'm looking
for the bathroom.
Ah, yes. It's right next
to the laxative booth.
(laughs) Clever, right?
So we meet again.
Oh, yeah. Uh, Danny, right?
How's your launch going?
Good.
Is Dr. Rostenkowski around?
No, she stepped out for a call,
although I wouldn't be surprised
if she's in line
to meet Ray Liotta.
Yeah. Something tells me
she's not crazy about me.
Yeah. Something tells me that,
too, and it was her.
Well, it doesn't matter, I was
actually hoping to talk to you.
Really?
Yeah.
You've done a terrific job
with Inflaminex.
We're always on the lookout
for great salespeople.
I think we could make you happy.
Uh, thanks,
but I'm pretty happy.
I could be more happy.
Tell it to your shrink, Karen.
Hey, Howie, everything okay?
Yeah, everything's great.
I was just wondering if we had
any large barbecue tongs.
Uh, bottom left drawer.
Are you guys grilling?
Nope, just playing games
with the kids.
Why do you need tongs?
Love you, too, bye.
I-I bet Michael grabs it
before Halley.
(Halley and Neil cooing)
Not a chance.
Halley's a year older, you know
she's gonna get it first.
I just think
he wants it more. Come on.
Come on, you got this.
You got this, Michael
Grab it. Grab it, Halley.
I believe in you.
Oh! That was so close.
Just keep on trying.
Hey. Hey, y-you guys want to
make this more interesting?
By establishing
a double-blind protocol
so we have a foundation
to publish? Yes.
Look, here's my card. Maybe we
can get a drink this weekend.
Oh, I don't know.
I'm pretty busy.
I have to inventory
all the giveaways.
Hey, beat it. Shoo.
So what did he want?
Nothing.
He offered her
a job.
No one likes a tattletale,
Karen.
So, what's up, traitor?
Dammit, Karen.
Okay, you want to engage
the babies.
The subjects.
The babies.
Fine. The babies.
Baby-A and Baby-B.
Engage them for a minute and
take note of their reactions.
There's something familiar
about all this.
Okay, go.
Hello, baby.
Are you having
a pleasant day?
Oh, my G--
This is my entire childhood.
Leonard, Leonard,
you're tainting my data.
Uh, it's like word for word.
How much time is left?
35 seconds.
Oh really?
He's not reacting at all.
Sheldon, he's a baby.
That's not how you talk
to him, okay? J-Just watch.
Hey.
Halley.
(baby talk):
Who's your favorite uncle?
HALLEY:
(giggles) Unka Koo.
I got a dud,
let's switch.
Keep trying. It's for science.
LEONARD:
Is that all
I was to her?
Just an experiment?
Michael. Michael,
you're making me look bad.
I-Interact with me.
(gasps) He grabbed my finger.
Oh, he's smiling.
I'm doing it.
That's time.
Oh, really?
Can we do one more?
I think these guys need
to get some food.
By pushing a lever at the end
of an obstacle course
that we design?
No, by opening the door
to a hangar and letting
the airplane fly in.
Although, Sheldon, maybe
it could be an experiment.
Are you suggesting
we color-code their food
so we can examine
their diapers later?
Sure.
These diapers
are gonna be full of data.
I never thought I would see
Sheldon enjoying himself
around babies so much.
Yeah, how about that?
So he just happened
to stumble upon a book
about experimenting
with them the same day
we were hanging out
with Howard's kids?
Yep, don't overthink it.
LEONARD:
Oh, my God.
At sleepaway camp my cabin
was called ""Control Group.""
I can't believe you took
his business card.
I can't believe we're still
talking about this.
He handed it to me.
What was I supposed to do?
Hand it back to him
and tell him
to stick it
where the sun don't shine.
You are not serious.
Serious as the hepatitis
their cholesterol medication
gave thousands of people.
Did it?
Maybe.
You're not really
considering this, are you?
I don't know.
It's kinda flattering.
Please, he's just using you
to get to me.
Or he's trying to get to me
because I'm really good
at my job.
(scoffs) Don't be so naive.
They're our number one
competitor.
They have a rival drug
coming out
with a name I wish
we thought of-- Forsootha.
It's got ""soothe"" right in it.
How did we miss that?
You know, our
brand recognition
is three times
higher than theirs.
And I did that with a stupid
product name and no assistant.
You only have this job
because I gave it to you.
You know who else
was begging you
to head up their sales team?
Nobody.
Well, you know who's
begging me now? Danny.
I can't believe this is how
you thank me.
I thanked you
by thanking you.
And I sent you
that fancy box of pears.
What am I supposed to do
with 20 pears?
Have a pear party?
Ooh, a juicy pear.
Where are the kids?
Oh, Sheldon's helping Howard
give them a bath.
Hmm. So you really think
you can trick Sheldon
into liking babies?
I slept with him;
I married him.
You want to be
against me?
Oh, you were right, Amy.
There were so many
valuable experiments
to perform on them
during bath time.
You don't say.
I do. I tested their object
permanence with a rubber duck,
and we took a run at Archimedes'
water displacement,
but that went
right over their heads.
Well, I'm glad
you had a good day.
I did.
It's so funny,
we did all these experiments
on them
and they didn't even notice.
I know, I was worried it would
be obvious, but it wasn't.
I guess we should go and let
Howard get them ready for bed.
Yeah. Do you think he'd let us
come back and do some more?
Maybe we could take them
to the park.
(gasps) Smart.
There'll be more babies.
It's a bigger sample size.
Where did Leonard go?
Just tell me the truth, Mother.
Was my whole childhood
just one big experiment?
BEVERLY (on phone):
Of course not, dear.
It was thousands
of small experiments.
So that's all I was to you,
a-a test subject?
No, you were my baby
and I found you fascinating.
Really?
Yes, watching you develop,
tracking your progress.
I know I'm not
the warmest of parents,
but it was time
we spent together,
and, honestly, those are
some of my fondest memories.
When did you stop?
Oh, I can't tell you,
the experiment isn't over.
Zangen's a fine company.
They got a couple
of good drugs,
but we control 60%
of the market.
Hell, commissions on just
our fungal creams
will put you
in a new Mercedes.
Danny. Danny, look at me.
Does this face
sell fungal creams?
No. This face is cholesterol
drugs and above.
Playing hard to get, huh?
(laughs) No one's ever
accused me of that before.
Look, why don't I just give you
a number and see what you think?
Ooh, are-are you gonna
write it on a napkin
and slide it over to me?
No, I was just gonna say it.
Aw.
Do you want me
to write it on a napkin
and slide it over to you?
Yah.
You got it.
Danny, you rat bastard.
What? I'm just making
your friend an offer.
Yeah, he's writing it on
a napkin like in the movies.
(scoffs) That's not an offer.
Do you know how amazing
this girl is?
Aw. You think I'm amazing?
Stay out of this.
I'm serious..
Not only is she
a helluva salesperson,
she's the hardest worker
I've ever seen.
I know, that's why I'm trying
to steal her from you.
Well, then you're gonna have
to do a lot better than this,
because I promise you,
I'm not gonna let
her go without a fight.
You do not want that,
she's a biter.
Just think about it.
You know, I don't have to.
Thanks, but I'm
happy where I am.
Let's go.
Can I just see
what he wrote on the napkin?
What napkin?
You know, spending time
with Michael and Halley today
really made me think
about our future children.
Huh, what an interesting
and completely
unforeseen development.
What are you thinking?
Well, I just can't decide.
Either five sets of triplets
or three sets of quintuplets.
You know what? It doesn't matter
as long as they're healthy.
And divisible by three.
That's a lot
of babies, Sheldon.
Oh, only for humans.
For frogs, it's just
a drop in the bucket.
Well, I'm sorry
I'm not a frog.
Oh, don't feel bad, Amy.
You're good enough for me."
s11ep4.xml,"It feels like it wasn't that long ago
we were here doing this for Halley.
Because it wasn't.
Which reminds me, before we leave,
let's get you a vasectomy.
Ohh, that's sweet, but today's all about you.
So you two ready
to find out the sex of this baby?
-Yeah.
-Absolutely.
Is Halley hoping
for a little brother or a little sister?
Well, she's 9 months old. So unless it
jingles or is in my bra, she doesn't care.
And how about you two?
You know, for the first one,
we really wanted a girl.
But this time around,
we don't have a preference.
Yeah, boy, girl, as long as it's healthy.
[ULTRASOUND HUMMING]
Well, it's a boy.
BOTH:
Oh.
Oh, come on.
You can't really be disappointed.
Hey, I barely know how to be a man myself.
Now I have to teach someone?
As the saying goes,
""Those who can't do, teach.""
Don't you want a little version of Howard?
I already have a little version of Howard.
Now I'm having a son?
I'll have to teach him how to play sports...
...and watch sports.
And-- And-- And--
He just ran out of ""man"" things.
He's in trouble.
It's okay. We're all here to help.
Yes, and this baby will have plenty
of manly role models.
Now, I'm certain that whatever Bernadette
can't teach him, Penny can.
-Oh, she can pee into a bottle.
PENNY: Mm-hm.
Anything with a neck wider than a nickel.
Howie, there's a lot of amazing things
you can teach a son.
Yeah, you do always know
how to pick just the right antacid.
I don't know if I can teach that.
It's just something I was born with.
Come on. You can build things.
You were an astronaut.
That's true.
You know, as a kid, I used to make model
rockets. That'd be pretty cool to do with a son.
Model rockets. Finally.
Something interesting.
What is your preferred mode of recovery?
Sheldon, we're helping our friends.
And we got to model rockets.
It was a tedious road,
but well worth the effort.
-Have you thought of names?
-We finally got to model rockets.
Why are you turning back?
-Where you going?
-Back to the dry cleaner. Look.
They didn't get the stain
out of my Starfleet uniform.
Well, if you didn't make me
wear the green body paint in bed...
...you wouldn't have to
get it dry cleaned so much.
No, it's worth it.
[LAPTOP CHIMING]
Hey, wait, it's your mom.
Oh, too bad. She just missed me.
Hey, Beverly.
Oh, hello, Penny.
Leonard just left. He's gonna be
so upset he missed your call.
Why?
Because he--
Yeah, I don't know. How are you?
Did you mean personally or professionally?
Personally? Like, what'd you do last night?
I had Cuban food at the home of a man
with whom I shared unsatisfying intercourse.
Wow. Okay.
And to anticipate your next questions...
...roasted pork and sideways missionary.
Sure. Sure. Because you were full.
I haven't looked at all this stuff in years.
Had it. Had it.
Burnt down my garage with it.
I had three model rockets as a kid.
And that was the largest
space program in India.
You have a replica Saturn V?
Yeah, my dad bought it
before he, you know...
...abandoned our family.
Lucky duck.
I could never bring myself
to open it without him.
It's silly.
That's not silly.
I always wanted my dad to build
rockets with me, but he wasn't interested.
Yes. Disappointing fathers.
Tell me about it.
I remember for my 16th birthday,
my dad bought me a Mercedes.
Like, a little one. Like, a starter Mercedes.
He had barely handed me the keys
before he had to rush back to work.
I didn't see him again till,
like, pretty late that night.
Anyway...
...as angry as I was with him leaving...
...building this stuff is probably
what led me to become an engineer.
I suppose, in his own way,
my dad also encouraged me to pursue science.
I mean, he is the one that taught me
that flatulence is combustible.
And also,
polyester gym shorts don't burn.
They melt.
Yeah, I guess I'm an astrophysicist because
as a kid I said I liked to look at the stars.
So my dad sent me to Hawaii
to visit the Keck telescope.
Screw you. My pain is real.
You know what, forget the past.
What do you say
you and me build this rocket.
That sounds like it could be
a real bonding experience for us.
-Right?
-Oh, I see.
You think that's a positive.
So you didn't wanna hang out
with Sheldon and Howard?
No, they were bonding
over their sad childhoods.
And my stupid parents
were always there for me.
What's all this?
I'm just boxing up all the clothes Halley's
outgrown. Guess we won't need them anymore.
Slow down. I'm sure there's some
you could reuse for a boy.
""Daddy's little girl""?
Okay, well, what if we change it to say:
""Daddy's little girl magnet.""
Boom, boy shirt.
What about this?
Okay.
Pull off the skirt, slap a lightning bolt
on the front, and you've got Baby Flash.
Oh! Stick a long sleeve under it.
Boom, Baby Sheldon.
-Wow, you're really good at this.
-Oh, please.
This isn't my first time
turning girl clothes into boy clothes.
Why?
You got your sister's hand-me-downs?
Yeah, that.
Oh, I should've brought peanuts.
You can't eat peanuts. You're allergic.
If you die, who's going to drive me home?
I'm not gonna eat them.
It's a thing they do at JPL.
When the Ranger mission had a successful
launch, there were peanuts in the room.
Ever since then,
they have them at every launch.
That sounds like a silly superstition.
It's more of a tradition.
Ohh! I do love a tradition.
Pull over at the next peanut store.
I don't think that's a real thing.
Oh, don't be pedantic.
Any nut store will do.
I don't think we can get peanuts out here.
Oh, well, then this whole day's ruined.
Now that I think about it,
maybe it is more of a superstition.
Whew. That was close.
[CELL PHONE CHIMING]
Oh, hey, Beverly.
You called my phone, not Leonard's.
Actually, I was hoping to speak with you.
Is this a good time?
That depends.
What time is it where you are?
Just after 5.
Ahem. Yeah, that counts. What's up?
Well, I enjoyed
our conversation the other day.
And I was hoping to continue it.
Really?
Yes. You may find this surprising...
...but I don't have a lot of
what you would call ""girlfriends.""
What?
Of course there are my female colleagues...
...but they're all Freudians.
So the only boy that I can
dish about is my father. Ha-ha-ha.
Well, I'm here for you.
What do you wanna talk about?
Well, last time, we focused on my life.
If we're going to be real girlfriends,
we should talk about you as well.
Well, if we're gonna be real girlfriends...
...we should get a third girl
we can trash behind her back.
Oh, so we'd be catty.
Oh, I like it.
What about Sheldon's fiancé?
She seems a bit dour.
""Dour""? Meow.
All right. Here we go.
L-minus-ten.
-Nine.
-What are you doing?
It's ""T-minus.""
I was an astronaut. We used ""L-minus.""
Yeah, but this is a Saturn V. When they
launched those, they said, ""T-minus.""
It's my rocket. We're doing it my way.
Fine.
I'm not saying I know why your dad left,
but I think I'm getting an idea.
L-minus-ten, nine, eight, seven, six--
Because you're kind of bossy.
Five, four, three, two, one.
I remember them going up higher.
Well, that's perfect.
The one thing I thought I could
do with my son. I can't even do that right.
If you wanna see it again, I got it on video.
It's pretty cool in slow motion.
Thank you for your support.
-You're welcome.
-I was being sarcastic.
How dare you?
Sheldon, what am I gonna do?
What do I know about raising a boy?
What do you know about raising a girl?
Oh, my God.
You're right.
Well, I don't know
if that was sarcasm or not.
So either, ""You're welcome,"" or ""Hey.""
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
Leonard, did you really just text me from the
couch to put extra mustard on your sandwich?
I was worried
you might not check your e-mail.
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
-I swear to God I will throw this out.
-That one was not me.
Oh, wait. It's just your mom.
My mother's texting you?
Yeah, we've been talking a lot lately.
Why?
Is she sick of talking
to the Magic Mirror on the wall?
No, I thinks she's lonely.
She's been reaching out.
Okay, just be careful.
You think you're getting close to her.
The next thing you know,
you're featured in a book called:
He's Doing It on Purpose:
Raising a Teenage Bed Wetter.
No, it's not like that.
You know, she's been
opening up about her life.
She's been really supportive about mine.
-Really?
-Yeah.
I've been telling her about my job.
She said she was proud of me.
Well, that's great.
She never told me she was proud of me.
Even when I stayed dry for a whole month.
Do you not want me
to be friends with your mom?
Well, let's be clear.
I married you to hurt her.
You're kind of ruining it.
Reason number 13 to feel good:
As a launch, it was bad.
But as an explosion, it was glorious.
Reason 14:
You still have all your fingers.
And boys prefer a dad with fingers.
Thanks for trying, but you're not
gonna be able to cheer me up.
Well, how about this then?
You quit your whining before I give you
something to cry about, young man.
What?
Those are comforting words
my father would often say.
Did it help?
I turned out great. You tell me.
Let's get going.
You gonna be this mopey
all the way home?
I don't know. Maybe.
There any chance you'd be cheered up
by an amazing trigonometry riddle?
Well, if you can't answer that,
there's no way you're gonna get this riddle.
Oh, hey. Hey, what do you think?
Just because it's a boy, I don't think you need
to put a picture of genitals on his shirt.
What? That's a baseball bat
with two little baseballs.
Okay, yeah, now I see it.
So, you know...
...I understand why Howard is nervous about
having a son, but are you really upset about it?
No, I'm fine.
It's just, I grew up with a bunch of brothers.
So I thought it'd be nice for Halley
to have a sister. Is that wrong?
Of course it's wrong. You don't know
what this little boy's gonna be like.
Maybe he'll be rough and tumble.
Or maybe he'll be sweet and sensitive.
Or maybe he'll be all those things, like me.
You're rough and tumble?
You bet I am, bitch.
But I'm also sensitive
and regret saying that.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
-Hey.
-Hello.
You got a sec?
Sure, what's up?
Penny's been talking to my mother
like they're best friends.
And it's kind of freaking me out.
Okay.
I am pretty sure they're not best friends.
Because you can only have one best friend.
And Penny has that, and, tsk, it's me.
Oh, really? Is she FaceTiming
with you right now?
She's FaceTiming with my mom.
And believe me,
that is not a face you want to spend time with.
Hm. Well, I have been pretty busy lately.
Maybe I've been neglecting our friendship.
Penny knows I have a complicated relationship
with my mother. She doesn't care.
And with everything going on at the lab and
planning the wedding, I have so little free time.
Penny doesn't know
how manipulative my mother can be.
Did you know there's such a thing as
reverse-reverse-reverse psychology?
Because there is.
She must feel so abandoned.
She's used to me being there all the time.
But now I have my own life,
and she's just gonna have to accept it.
And why is my mom
proud of Penny and not me?
The question is: why is Penny
afraid of me growing as a person?
-I'm good at stuff too.
-I deserve my own life.
-Okay, well, thanks.
-Yeah, good talk.
You know, studies have shown that...
...people distracted by emotional issues
are poor drivers.
What about people distracted
by irritating passengers?
That would be hard to test because
irritating is a subjective quality.
Strongly disagree.
Can I drive?
No, you can't drive.
You don't even have a license.
Actually, I do.
Really?
Since when?
Three years ago.
I went on a bit of a license kick.
I'm also a commercial fisherman.
Then why don't you ever drive yourself?
Honestly, I barely passed my test.
And the one time I drove on my own,
I made a U-turn...
...got dizzy, threw up and walked home.
You really wanna drive?
It seems like the perfect time.
The roads are straight.
There's no one around.
And you don't seem to care
if you live or die.
Live, Sheldon. I wanna live.
That makes things a little trickier,
but I'll do my best.
[DIAL TONE ON LAPTOP]
Hi, Penn-- Oh, hello, Leonard.
Hello, Mother. How are you?
-Fine, and you?
-I'm great.
-Well, it's been lovely catching up.
-No.
Wait, hang on. We need to talk.
Oh, brother.
I wanna know why aren't you proud of me.
Well, isn't the real question
why aren't you proud of yourself?
No, that is a question.
And I ask it a lot.
But let's stick with the one I asked you.
Well, why do you think
I'm not proud of you?
Because you never say it.
But two days into chatting with Penny,
and you can't stop telling her how great she is.
She is great.
Honestly, of all of my children's spouses,
she's the one that I'm most impressed by.
-Seriously?
-Yes.
She's confident. She's thoughtful.
And she never complained about you once.
I know what kind of strength that takes.
So Penny's your favorite.
I suppose she is.
You married well, Leonard.
And for that, I am proud of you.
I don't know what to say.
I'm also proud of how hard
you're trying not to cry.
Thank you.
-Would you like to hang up now?
-Yeah, here it comes.
Your hands are at 10 and 2. Good.
Steady on the gas.
Okay.
Now, you're gonna
wanna slowly switch lanes.
-Why?
-Because there are only two...
...and you're not in either of them.
Attaboy. Well done.
Thank you.
The last time I drove,
I was terrified, but this is fun.
You're doing great.
You're a good teacher.
Your son is going to be lucky
to have you as a father.
Thanks.
Do you think I could try going a little faster?
-Go for it, champ.
-Ow.
Sorry. Just ease on the gas and--
Too much. Too much.
Why was I scared of this?
This is exhilarating.
No, it's not. Slow down.
Don't tell me what to do.
You're not my father.
-You know how fast you were going?
-A hundred and twelve.
Let me see your license.
-Okay, here's the plan.
-No.
Fine.
There you go.
You know what, you can just keep it."
s11ep5.xml,"-Thanks for letting me put Halley in your room.
-No problem.
Penny, she threw up on your stuffed bear.
-Oh, that's okay.
-Hey. That's an Ewok and it's mine.
Yeah. Which is why it's okay.
See, he gets Ewoks in his bed.
You've got Chewbacca. That's enough.
I used to have the stuffed raccoon
from
Guardians of the Galaxy...
...but Cinnamon licked it raw.
There's a time and place
for your randy dog stories...
...and it's never and nowhere.
Yeah, no more stories about sex,
so Amy that brings us to you.
At work we've been doing interesting research
with neuroprosthetics.
Neat. I've been rewatching
The O.C.,
so we're all leading productive lives.
Been working on a computer interface
that can use brain wave patterns...
...to control robotic limbs.
We're having trouble localizing the signal
from the EEG cap.
Have you thought about adding a phased array
of sensors for better localization?
Actually, that never occurred to me.
It never occurred to me
I would miss the Ewok conversation.
Good, because I just bought another one
on Amazon.
-I could use an engineer on this project.
-Well, this works out great.
Howard's an engineer,
I'm sure he knows someone qualified.
She was talking about me, Sheldon.
I'm perfectly qualified.
Yeah, Howie's the world's best engineer.
It says so right on his coffee mug.
-You got him a mug?
-I did.
But it's not a competition.
Yeah, I lost that battle years ago.
So, Howard, are you interested?
You kidding? If I can control robot arms
with my brain, I'd be able to do so many things.
You've been controlling human arms
with your brain for years...
...and not much has come of it.
-Hey, what you reading?
-A parenting book.
Oh, my God. Are we...?
What, no!
You think this is how I would tell you?
Well, you're sitting there with a book.
It felt like anything was possible. I don't know.
Bernadette left it here.
-Anything interesting?
-I saw a picture of a baby's head crowning...
...so I hope you enjoyed sex,
because we're done with that.
-Hello.
-Hey, Sheldon, what's up?
Remember how disappointed you were
when Amy started driving me to work?
Sure.
Sometimes people smile
a big smile of disappointment.
Good news, Amy had to go in early to show
Howard around her lab, so you get to drive me.
Aw, his smile of disappointment
has turned into a frown of joy.
It's fine. I've been driving him for years.
What's one more day?
I've got a new game we can play
called ""What Siren Am I?""
Kill me.
Amy, your lab is amazing.
A C-arm fluoroscope, a cranial ultrasound.
And look at that coffee maker.
I know. On our expense report, I listed it
as ""Eduardo,"" my Colombian lab assistant.
So this is it?
Yes, we're using it to map brain wave patterns
and converting them into electrical impulses...
...used to control anything
from wheelchairs to robots.
Based on that ring,
I'd say you're pretty good at controlling robots.
Careful, that's my fiancé you're talking about
and I can program him to hurt you.
[IMITATES SIREN WAILING]
I don't know. French police?
Oh, so close. Belgian ambulance.
Ready for your next one?
Just a warning, this one's a little annoying.
[WAILING]
Take a little-- Little break.
I'm getting a headache.
Oh. Right in the middle of our fun game.
Yeah, weird.
So Howard and Amy working together,
that's interesting, huh?
It's all right. Usually when Amy complains
about her co-workers, I just tune her out...
...but now I'll be able to join in
and pound away.
-You're not jealous of Howard, are you?
-Of course not.
The only engineer I'm jealous of
is the one who blows the train whistle.
Ooh! That just gave me an idea for a new game,
""What Whistle Am I""?
Train.
For your information,
it was going to be tea kettle.
But the tea kettle was on a train,
so I'll give it to you.
If we add phase detection to your EEG sensors,
I'll have to rewrite most of the code.
Can you do that?
These hands were made to do three things:
close-up magic, writing code...
...and the dirty shadow puppet show
that got me kicked out of Hebrew school.
Hello.
Hi. What a nice surprise.
Well, I just came by
to see how you two were getting along.
-Everything is going really great.
-Oh, that's nice to hear.
I was hoping you two
would enjoy working together.
What's with the blinking?
It's Morse code.
So we can talk about....
Without hurting...feelings.
Sheldon, I don't know Morse code.
I do. And if you have something to say,
you can say it to my face.
Oh. All right.
I'm a little rusty. Could you say that again?
She's going to be home at 8-ish.
When is that? 8:01, 8:02?
And what kind of scientist uses ""ish""?
I'll give it a go.
My ride home with you was hell-ish.
If you wanna join us for dinner,
you're more than welcome.
Thank you.
I don't think I'd be good company tonight.
Well, then out you go.
Okay. What is going on?
Ever since Amy started working with Howard,
she hasn't been home.
Didn't that just start this morning?
And has she been home?
You know, that would frustrate me.
-Does it frustrate you?
-It does.
I get that.
You know, it's okay to feel frustrated
when things aren't going your way.
I suppose. Maybe it's not that big a deal.
No. No, no, your feelings are valid.
Now, why don't you go wash up
and we'll call you when dinner's ready.
Okay.
What did you do? Are you a witch?
I've been reading Bernadette's parenting book.
It's like the answer key to the Sheldon test.
-That's amazing.
-I know. But it's only birth to 5.
What do we do when he turns 6?
Take him to the zoo and leave him there.
Hey, Bernadette.
Hey, Raj. Howard's not here.
I know. He's been in the lab every night
this week with his work wife.
That's weird. I thought his work wife
was standing in my kitchen.
Don't be snippy,
I came to see how you were doing.
Like, do you need help with anything?
Thank you. There are a few things around the
house I've been waiting for Howard to get to.
-The smoke alarms need--
-No. I meant emotionally?
How are you feeling?
Like you're not really here to help me.
Wow, still snippy.
Everything's fine.
Howard's really excited about his work,
he's been in a great mood. I'm proud of him.
And I can fit into the pants
I wore in high school.
Come on. We don't need to lie to each other.
You're right. I have a teething baby,
I'm pregnant, I have a proposal due tomorrow...
...I don't have time to hear
about how much you're missing my husband.
Well, I think I know
why he's been working so late.
-Hi.
-Welcome home.
How was work?
-Great. Howard had an idea for--
-That's enough about work.
You just got here,
you need to sit down and let me pamper you.
Well, that sounds nice.
I got you a little something
to help you relax.
Sheldon, that is the sweetest, most--
What is this?
The notes
from our quantum cognition project.
I thought we could spend the evening
grinding away on it.
I just got home. I'm tired.
Of Howard, I know.
So how about you and me make
some beautiful science together?
Sheldon, I wanna work on this with you,
just not tonight. What if we get up early...
...and do it in the morning?
I promise I'll be way more into it.
You know what?
There was a time you would've been happy
to stay up and collaborate all night...
...and then wake up in the morning
and do it some more.
Fine, but can we make it quick?
No. If you're gonna make me
do all the work, then go to bed.
But don't be surprised if you walk out here
and catch me doing it myself.
Sheldon's texting me
to drive him to Bernadette's.
-What are you gonna say?
-They introduced the middle finger emoji.
If it's not for this, I don't know what it's for.
No, no. He'll just think
that means ""be there in a minute.""
Maybe there's something
in the book that will help.
Worth a shot.
Okay. Let's see, let's see.
""Biting other children""?
Sometimes, but problem for another day.
Okay, here we go.
""Let him have ownership of his choices.
Allow him to choose from options
that are acceptable to you.""
I don't know, I'll give it a try.
I can drive you in two hours
or you can take an Uber.
Good. See, now he feels
like he has a choice.
[PHONE BLEEPING]
He's gonna take an Uber.
Wow, it worked.
Unless he bites the driver, yeah.
And now they're working on a Saturday.
Can you believe them?
-Is this how you envisioned your weekend?
-No, it is not.
This whole thing is maddening.
I'm really busy.
I don't have time to listen to you complain.
Hey, you're complaining too.
""Sheldon, why are you here?""
""Sheldon, the applesauce is for the baby.""
What do you want?
I just wish I could make Howard
feel as angry as I'm feeling.
Well, maybe you could do something he likes
and make him jealous.
-Like what?
-Have you ever read
Tom Sawyer?
-No.
-Chores. He likes chores.
What kind of chores?
Well, you could change the batteries
in the smoke detectors.
That would drive him crazy.
That's great. Oh, he'll be so mad,
smoke will be coming out of his ears.
And then the smoke detectors will detect it.
Hold on,
why did you ask me about
Tom Sawyer?
I'm just interested in you.
Oh, you are sweeter than your applesauce.
I'm gonna extend the wait time and have it
poll the A-to-D converter at the top of the loop.
That's impressive.
You think that's impressive,
take apart that brain model.
Oh, my God. Three of clubs.
That was my card! How'd you--?
I used to make it appear in my pants,
but HR said I had to stop doing that.
So how much longer till we can test it?
It needs to compile,
so it's gonna be a few minutes.
-Sounds like we've earned ourselves a break.
-You wanna hear some Neil Sedaka?
You know, that's your greatest magic trick,
because you just read my mind.
[MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
BOTH [SINGING ALONG]:
I love, I love, I love my calendar girl
Yeah, sweet calendar girl
I love, I love, I love my calendar girl
Each and every day of the year
January....
Well, well, well.
[MUSIC STOPS]
-Hi.
-Hey.
You say you're busy as bees,
yet here you are, dancing.
Although, I suppose bees do dance,
but their dance lets other bees know...
...where the pollen is, and yours does not.
My logic, despite that slight detour,
does track.
We're waiting for my code to compile.
What are you doing here?
I stopped by to see if you wanted
to go to the movies with me.
I'd love to, but we're just about
to test the interface. It could take a while.
Okay, buddy, it's not my place...
...but Bernadette's feeling a little abandoned
with all the hours you've been putting in.
-You asked him to go to the movies.
-But our weird relationship...
...was grandfathered into their marriage
and yours was not.
Okay, I put new batteries
in the smoke detectors.
-Did you do the laundry?
-I sure did.
He's gonna be steamed.
Just like his dress shirts.
At least he could still clean the oven.
-That's something.
-That's what he thinks.
-Where's your steel wool?
-Right here.
We make quite the team.
Sure do.
Guys, you won't believe this.
I stopped by the university to check in
on Howard and Amy and they were having fun.
Don't worry. He won't be having any fun when
he gets home. I did all his favorite chores.
What are you talking about?
Howard hates doing chores.
Then why would Bernadette tell me that--?
Bernadette.
Did you play on my well-established gullibility
to clean your house?
Sure did.
Well, I would storm out of here...
...but I already have the gloves and steel wool,
and I really do love cleaning an oven. Move.
She made me do all her chores...
...and it wasn't even her idea.
She stole it from
Tom Sawyer.
You know what? This is crazy. Howard
and Amy are working together. Get over it.
-Leonard, what are you doing?
-Knowing when to say when. Not a big deal.
It is a big deal. Howard's getting Amy used
to laughing and listening to music.
What if she expects that madness at home?
A good point. I'm proud of the way
you're able to express your feelings.
Thank you. I'm just so angry.
You know, everyone gets angry.
Even mommies and daddies.
You can't think this is the right time
to validate his behavior.
What about ""presenting a united front""?
What about you coddling him
and he's never gonna learn?
You sound frustrated.
And I'm really proud of the way
you're able to state your opinion.
Thank you. What? No, no!
Don't use that book on me.
Hey, what book?
Penny's been using one
of Bernadette's parenting books on you.
What? So has he.
What makes you think
you can treat me like a child?
Your shampoo comes in a Big Bird bottle.
That's because the adult shampoo
burns my man eyes.
-Hey, what are you working on?
-Oh, my God. You're still here?
Of course I'm here.
I know what you're going through.
Really? You have a needy Indian man
in your house?
I did, but then he came over here.
Is this how it's gonna be
if we have kids, you'll throw me under the bus?
If you spoil them the way you do Sheldon,
yeah.
My way was working. You're upset because
there are some things I'm better than you at.
Well, you can't end a sentence
with a preposition, so clearly not grammar.
Was that a smart thing to say?
That depends. Before I said it,
was sex on the table?
-No.
-Then it's fine.
Once we get this operational,
we could figure out how to make it wireless.
That'd be amazing.
[PHONE CHIMES]
Oh, that's Sheldon.
Oh, he's upset with Leonard and Penny.
[PHONE CHIMES]
And Bernadette.
[PHONE CHIMES]
And Mark Twain.
Yeah, Bernadette texted earlier.
Raj is really getting on her nerves.
I guess we have been working late a lot.
Should we call it a night and go home?
Or we could brew a pot of coffee
and power through.
I don't know, it's getting kind of late.
Hey, where's my watch?
Why don't you ask your skeleton?
[AMY GASPS]
Oh, my God, how is that even possible?
This is great, the two of us hanging out.
Why didn't we think of this earlier?
Agreed. I don't need Amy to watch a movie.
I can not hold your hand just as easily.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]
In the book this is based on,
that man's the killer."
s12ep16.xml,"All right,
Professor Proton fans,
get ready to meet
Dr. Sheldon Cooper
and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,
a pair of real-life scientists
who may win the Nobel Prize.
That's like
the Kids' Choice Award,
but with more science
and less slime.
Hi, thanks for having us.
Kids' Choice Award?
Why would they let kids
choose anything?
They're basically
human larvae.
Well, they are kind of
our target audience.
Greetings, children.
Toys, am I right?
He is. He has hundreds of them.
So you two have
discovered something
that a lot of people
are really excited about.
(chuckles) We have.
Now, before
you explain it,
keep in mind that our
average viewer is this many.
Okay, imagine you're
looking in a mirror.
The image you see
looks just like you.
That's called symmetrical.
Now imagine you have
a billion mirrors,
and each of them reflects
one thing about you correctly
and a billion things
about you incorrectly.
And imagine the set
of incorrect things
are floating in an abstract
n-dimensional hyperspace.
Now imagine there was never
a mirror to begin with.
Oh, was that
a doorbell?
I didn't
hear anything.
(doorbell rings)
Huh, there it is again.
Sheldon, why don't
you answer it?
But I don't know who it is.
Maybe it's a special guest who
I invited just to surprise you.
Why don't you open it up
and find out.
This is a terrible message
to send to children.
Children, you never
open the door
if you don't know
who's on the other side.
You always make your
mommy or daddy do it
while you hide under the bed
and try to imagine
what your superhero name will be
when you avenge their deaths.
I'll get it.
But it can't be The Silver
Shadow-- that's mine.
Hello.
Captain on the bridge!
Captain on the bridge!
You're William Shatner.
You can call me Bill.
Ooh, can I call you Captain?
No.
Please?
No.
(whispers):
Please?
Sure.
And w-will you call me
Science Officer Cooper?
This has got to stop.
I think you know
how to make it stop.
Put her there,
Science Officer Cooper.
Put her there,
Science Officer Cooper.
(Sheldon vomits)
Oh, poor Shatner.
Poor Shatner?
I have to eat lunch now.
Look, Sheldon's
pretty embarrassed,
so when he gets here,
we should...
Make fun of him?
(chuckles)
A lot.
Guys, don't you think
that's a little mean?
Yeah.
Okay, just so we're
all on the same page.
Yeah.
Hello.
OTHERS:
Hey.
So, Sheldon,
did you get
William Shatner's autograph,
or maybe his dry cleaning bill?
(chuckles)
Very funny, get it all out.
Like you did on William Shatner?
Raj, do you have
something to add?
You brought shame upon
yourself and your family.
It's not funny,
but it's true.
I will admit the meeting
did not go the way I wanted.
(à la Shatner):
Because you barfed where no man
has barfed before?
Well, the next time I meet him,
it will go better.
Next time? What makes you think
there's gonna be a next time?
Wil will give me another chance.
He thinks the world of me.
Aw. One of the reasons
I love you
is you actually believe that.
Thank you.

are at the gate,
and you're at the door
buying Girl Scout Cookies.
Is that William Shat...?
Nope.
Hey, you guys want to read
my fan fiction mash-up,
""Captain Marvelous Mrs. Maisel""?
Nope.
No.
Certainly not.
You don't even know
what it's about.
Is it about
a superhero
who finds her voice
by doing stand-up?
That's so much better
than what I had.
Mine is just a Jewish girl
that flies.
I'd read that.
Guys, guys,
Wil Wheaton
hosts a secret
celebrity D&D game.
How do you know?
Who was there?
Why are you damp?
I was trying to peek
in Wil's window,
and he turned the sprinklers on.
Oh, that means they
must be really famous.
I'm almost positive
I heard William Shatner.
I wonder who else is playing.
I-I bet we can use graph theory
to determine who Wil knows
and who is likely to play D&D.
Yes.
Okay, obviously he's connected
to the whole
Next Gen
cast...
So this is the rest
of our night, huh?
Oh, no,
this is the rest of our lives.
And Josh Brolin gets
you to every Avenger.
Kevin Smith's
in this article
about celebrities who play D&D.
Oh! A-And he was
on Wil's podcast,
so they know each other.
G-Go on his Instagram,
see if you can find anything.
Yeah, he-he posted something
an hour ago:
""#GameNight.""
That looks like Wil's house.
William Shatner,
Kevin Smith--
who else could be there?
Do you see what I see
over his shoulder?
Is that a ghost?
I think it's Stuart.
That
is
Stuart.
What-What's he doing there?
Maybe he died in Wil's house
and he can't leave
until he solves his own murder.
Why would Wil invite
Stuart and not us?
I know the answer.
Yeah.
We all know the answer.
Hey, guys.
You're home late.
Uh, yeah.
I had a crazy night.
I went to the pharmacy.
I like to be there when
the new decongestants drop.
Cut the crap.
We know where you were.
We know what
you were doing.
Yeah, I just told you. I was
at CVS breathing my ass off.
Oh, you were breathing,
all right.
You were breathing the
rarefied air of celebrities.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Then why are
you trembling?
I'm always trembling.
We know you were
at Wil's D&D game.
We saw you on Instagram.
We just want to know
how you got invited.
I can't talk about it or they
won't invite me back next week.
So there's another
game next week.
I didn't mean to say that.
Who's in it?
I can't tell you!
How do we get invited?
I don't know!
How many hit dice are they
playing the wereboar as having?
12d8 + 24--
I mean, I don't know!
(phone ringing)
Hey, Stuart.
I don't want to play anymore.
It's too much pressure.
Why, what happened?
I've-I've said too much.
You haven't said anything.
Not to you, to them.
Who's them?
Ah! Now I
have
said too much!
But y-you blocked
your number, right?
Relax,
this is not my first
creepy phone call.
It's like riding a bike...
slowly past a girl's house.
WHEATON (over phone):
Hello.
(imitating Shatner):
Wil,
Bill Shatner here.
Is this Howard?
Of course not. It-It's Shatner.
If you don't believe me, ask my
good friend, Christopher Walken.
(imitating Walken):
Hello, Bill and I are just
hanging out...
at The Polo Lounge.
Mr. Shatner, Mr. Walken,
here are your martinis.
(glass dings)
(whispering in normal voice):
What are you doing?
I'm filling out the world.
You're ruining it.
No, he's not.
Thanks, Wil.
Sheldon, why are you walking
everywhere? Just get a horse.
I had a horse.
It got hit by a train.
Get another one.
I can't just replace Chauncey.
I'm still in the
grieving process.
(phone ringing)
Hey.
Hey, Leonard, I have an opening
in my D&D game next week,
and I was wondering if you
were interested in playing.
Well, yes, thank you.
Okay, great.
Now, here's the thing,
you can't tell anyone.
I'm serious,
not Howard, not Raj,
and certainly not Sheldon.
Okay.
I'm really sorry
to put you in a position
where you have to lie
to your friends...
See you there!
You come face to face
with a massive monster
with a gaping maw
full of teeth, three huge legs,
and flailing tentacles.
What do you do?
Fellas, it looks like
we're facing a, an otyugh.
Here's the plan...
Hold on there, Bill.
Now what, Kareem?
How do we know
it's not a neo-otyugh?
Same way I know
the difference
between an owlbear
and a bugbear.
Does that answer
your question?
No.
Look, there's one way
to settle this:
we chop it up
and look at the pieces.
Oh, come on, why do you always
got to attack everything?
Why can't we just try
talking to it?
Big surprise, Podcast
here wants to talk.
What do you think, Leonard?
I think this is the greatest day
of my entire life.
It's all right, buddy,
one day you'll meet a girl.
Hey, how was your lecture?
Oh, it was so good.
I-I-I mean, it-it started great,
and then the, the middle
was great,
and then the ending was like...
(imitates explosion)
So great.
Leonard, if you went to House
of Pies again, just say it.
(stammers)
Wait, if you think I'm lying,
why do you think
I'm eating pies?
Why don't you think I'm...
having an affair?
Listen, i-it's fine, just
next time, bring me a slice.
Okay, well, if you
really want to know,
I'll tell you where I was.
I was at Wil's D&D game,
but that's all I can say.
Oh, fun.
Were there famous people there?
Ah, sorry, I-I-I can't
tell you that.
Okay, well, yes,
but I-I-I-I can't
tell you who.
Well, no, I-I can
tell you Shatner,
but that's only because
you already knew that one.
Well, I'm glad you had fun.
Yeah.
Ugh, I wish I could tell you
who else was there.
(chuckles)
I can't, I promised.
Yeah, if it makes you feel
better, I couldn't care less.
That's true,
you don't care, so there's
no harm in telling you.
Okay, you really
don't have to.
All right,
I'll tell you. Uh...
(stammers)
Kevin Smith was there,
and-and, uh, this really
tall guy named Kareem.
Wait-wait,
K-Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
I don't know, it was, uh,
Kareem something Jabbar.
How do you know him?
How do you not know him?
Well, I know him now
'cause he was there.
Wow.
That is so cool.
Oh, a-and that, uh,
the guy that played
the werewolf on-on
True Blood,
he was there.
Wh-- Joe Manganiello?
Uh, yeah.
From
Magic Mike?
What's that?
Okay, okay,
did he look... like this?
He had his clothes on,
but, yeah.
(sighs)
I can't believe you
met Joe Manganiello.
Is he nice?
Oh, he's so nice.
I-I-I rolled my dice
underneath the couch,
and he just lifted
it up, one hand.
Oh, I-I bet he did.
Hi. Okay, can you guys
keep a secret?
Yeah.
Sure.
Good, 'cause I can't.
Leonard played
Dungeons & Dragons
with the hot guy
from
Magic Mike.
I never got to see that movie.
Seriously?
Yeah, Howie made us leave
as soon as he realized
it wasn't about magic.
Well, I have seen that movie
one or seven times,
and trust me, it is magic.
Which guy?
That one.
Abracadabra.
Hey, you know what was fun?
That time we played
Dungeons & Dragons.
That was fun.
We should play that more.
Sorry, what now?
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?
Oh, I, uh, think Sheldon
might have left something.
Oh, you mean, besides his lunch?
(laughter)
You are so funny, Wil.
We were just talking
about how funny you are.
Yeah, Leonard told you,
didn't he?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Yup.
Yeah.
It's Manganiello?
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Feel good about yourselves?
Nope.
No.
Yeah.
Oh, we're going
with no? No.
Hey, guys.
What are you
smiling about?
What? This is my regular face.
No, it's not.
Y-Your regular face
is more like this...
No, no, i-it's-it's more
in the eyebrows, like this...
(chuckles)
Okay, make your jokes.
I'm still in a great mood.
(phone ringing)
Hey.
Wait, what?
Why?
Oh, come on, but...
O-Okay, fine.
Huh, Raj was right,
it is more in the eyebrows.
What was that all about?
Wil kicked me out
of his D&D game.
You were
in Wil's D&D game?
With William Shatner?
And you didn't tell us?
I'm sorry,
Wil made me promise not to.
I thought
we were friends.
Oh, come on, you guys
would do the same thing.
No, we wouldn't!
I told you when I was
in spin class with
Scarlett Johansson.
It didn't even turn out
to be Scarlett Johansson.
Well, that's her
fault, not mine!
It doesn't matter
because Penny blabbed about it
and now I'm out.
So there's an open seat.
Wil!
Wil Wheaton!
Open! Open!
No. No. No.
Hell no.
Look, we know Leonard is out.
You need to fill a seat.
It should be one of us.
Or give me another chance.
I think me and Joe Manganiello
were really hitting it off.
Joe Manganiello was there?
From
Magic Mike?
You guys suck.
Agreed. You guys suck.
Let's go, Wil.
No.
All of you.
You're just
trying to use me
to get close
to my famous friends.
Do you know how
that makes me feel?
Flattered? (chuckles)
Used.
I was gonna
guess that.
One of the worst things
about being a celebrity
is you never know if people
like you for you.
Well, thanks
for letting me know.
(sighs)
You're right, that was
really crappy of us.
Yeah, I guess we just got
caught up in the excitement.
We're sorry, Wil.
We do like you for you.
And if it makes
you feel
any better, I don't even really
consider you a celebrity.
Should we go or do you want
to wait for the sprinklers?
Guys, I-I still feel
a little bad about Wil.
Me, too.
Yeah. We should invite him
to come play with us.
Ask him to bring
some chips
because we're all out.
(stammers)
Hey, Wil, this is Leonard.
(gasps)
Make it Bugles.
No, no, no, no, no,
pretzel sticks.
No, no, no, Bugles.
We're gonna play some D&D
and thought you might
want to join us.
Thank you, Leonard, but actually
I can't do it tonight.
Uh, how about another time?
Okay, great. Thanks. Bye.
Okay, where were we?
I was about to go all
Wrath of Khan
on the ogres.
Oh, man, that's it.
Put another dollar
in the
Star Trek
jar, Bill.
Worth it.
Speaking of putting
dollars in things...
I loved you
in
Magic Mike.
(chuckles)
Thanks. (chuckles)
Switch places with me.
Are we playing musical chairs
or Dungeons & Dragons?
Yeah, let's teach that ogre
what my broadsword tastes like.
I like your moxie.
Aw, and I like
your grandpa words.
My dad and I watched you win
back-to-back championships.
And I watched you sniff Joe's
hair when he wasn't looking.
Thank you again for inviting us,
and don't worry,
we won't tell the guys.
You know what, why don't
you tell the guys?
In fact, let's all
take a picture
and send it to
them right now.
(phones buzzing)
That's weird.
We deserve that."
s11ep7.xml,"Hey, who's free tonight?
-I think I--
-Hang on.
We've made this mistake before.
It's how we wound up
at his cousin Deepak's Tupperware party.
Hey, you use that collapsible bowl
all the time, and you know it.
It's not like that. I just thought
we could hang out and go to a bar.
-Sure.
-And watch cricket.
That sound you hear, ironically crickets.
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Bert.
-How you doing?
-Well, you know...
...we geologists always get a little sad
when Rocktober's over.
-Wordplay?
-Yes.
-Funny wordplay?
-What do you think?
-Eh.
-Trust your gut.
Sheldon, I've got these
4-billion-year-old meteorites.
I thought maybe they'd show signs
of neutrino interactions.
I could use someone like you
to help me with the math.
Oh. So they would act as natural
dark-matter detectors.
-That sounds interesting.
-It does, but it's still geology.
-Sorry, I don't have time to play rocks.
-I'm not asking you to play rocks.
I'm asking you to collaborate
on a research project.
Although, if there's time, I guess we could
play a round of zinc, zinc, piece of quartz.
Does sound better than cricket.
Thank you for asking.
Unfortunately, I have real science to do.
But you feel free to rock on.
That's how you do it.
All right.
Sheldon, what are you doing?
Bert's one of the top guys in his field.
And somewhere there's a mime
who's top in his field.
But you don't see me rushing to collaborate
with him on new ways to be stuck in a box.
Yeah, also something I would watch
instead of cricket.
Oh. Heh. Hello.
-Hey, Sheldon.
-Yeah, I've been thinking about it...
...and I suppose I could help you...
-...with your research.
-What changed your mind?
Bert, I'm a gift horse.
Don't look me in the mouth.
Sorry. I'm happy you want to help out.
If it's easier for you,
we could work at your office.
What? No, no, no, not in my office, no.
Let's do it here.
And in the evenings.
After everyone's gone home.
I just have to see if my evenings are free.
That's a joke. They are.
Okay. Well, then I will see you tonight.
[GASPS]
Or-- You know what? Close the blinds.
We can start right now.
[ALL CHEERING]
I don't get how you can enjoy cricket.
It makes no sense.
Did you just come here to complain?
Yeah, that's the sport of my people.
Oh. That's Ravichandran Ashwin.
He's amazing.
He makes Hardik Pandya
look like Bhuvneshwar Kumar.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Save some syllables for the rest of us.
Hey, I think that's Bernadette's friend
over there.
Oh, yeah. Hey, Ruchi.
I hope this isn't awkward.
The last time we met,
I embarrassed myself.
Let's see if you can go two for two.
-Hey, guys.
-Hey. Are you here by yourself?
Yeah, I couldn't convince anyone
to come watch cricket with me.
Tell me about it. I had to drag this guy.
-You're more than welcome to join us.
-Thanks.
[CROWD GROANS]
[SPEAKS IN HINDI]
What'd she say?
[SPEAKS IN HINDI]
Oh, that clears that up.
She's telling the bowler to bowl a yorker.
It's the most brutal bowl in cricket.
I was at the match when Shoaib
bowled back-to-back yorkers.
I was there too. What a coincidence.
Well, there were 120,000 people
at that match, so....
Yeah, India, right? Everywhere you go,
there's like 120,000 people. Heh.
So, what do you think of our chances
at the World Cup?
Ah. World Cup.
It will all depend if Kohli is batting in form.
I know. It doesn't even matter
how many all-rounders you have.
Isn't that the truth?
I was the best leg spinner
in my high school.
Yeah, I bowled the meanest googly.
Speaking of googlies.... Heh.
I'm gonna go.
I've been modeling different types
of dark matter...
...and the traces they'd leave
on the zircon inside your meteorite.
What's this one here?
That's actually a dark-matter model
of my own creation.
I call it the Cooper Boson.
Cool. I got to name a rock once.
I named it Moderately Sedimented Shale.
Guess I kind of pooped the bed on that one.
You know, Bert, I've got to say...
...this work has been surprisingly engaging.
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[RINGTONE PLAYING]
Hello, Amy.
What do you mean, where am I?
I'm in my office.
No, I'm at your office, and you're not here.
I thought I'd surprise you with dinner.
For future reference, the best surprises
are the ones I know about in advance.
Where are you?
It's a surprise.
Doesn't feel so good, does it?
I have food.
I thought we could eat together...
-...but I guess if you have other plan--
-What? I'm here!
[PANTING]
Exactly where I said I was.
Let's eat.
-Hello.
-Hey, buddy, what's up?
I need to talk to Penny alone.
[CHUCKLES]
What can I do for you?
Just a minute. I want to make sure
Leonard can't hear us.
I've got a box of cupcakes.
Okay, we're good.
I'm working with Bert...
...but I don't want anyone to find out.
Well, you just told me, so strong start.
Penny, this is serious.
My reputation is on the line.
What are people gonna think
when they see us collaborating?
I don't know. ""Poor Bert""?
I am a respected theoretical physicist.
I aspire to win a Nobel Prize someday.
No one's gonna take me seriously
if they find out I've been dabbling in geology.
Why not? They're both sciences.
And I know because they're classes my
high-school counselor said ""weren't for me.""
They're very different.
Physics answers the question:
what is the nature of the universe?
Geology answers the question:
what'd I just trip over?
All right, well,
then don't work with Bert.
-But I like the work.
-Then work with him.
-I'm ashamed of the field.
-Don't work with him.
-We could prove dark matter.
-Work with him.
-But I just--
-How many times are you gonna do this?
My record is 14.
Okay, this is about science.
Why'd you come to me?
Well, because it's also
about my reputation.
And somehow, you manage to hold
your head high despite your checkered past.
""Checkered past""?
It's a figure of speech referring
to how sexually promiscuous you were.
Really? Well, I've got a figure of speech...
...about how sexually promiscuous
you can go be with yourself.
And what is it?
While Bernadette's on bed rest,
we're gonna have to divide and conquer.
I've got one monitor for her,
one for the baby.
Which do you want?
I'll take the baby.
She's less emasculating.
Good morning. Scones.
-Thanks.
-They're all for you.
I already had breakfast at Ruchi's.
-You're kidding. You slept with her?
-There wasn't a lot of sleeping involved.
I mean, she slept, I stayed awake.
I was afraid of snoring
because I didn't have my special pillow.
BERNADETTE: Howard!
Can you help me to the bathroom?
At least the romance is still alive.
So you and Ruchi?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I know you liked her too, but
we just bumped into each other and hit it off.
No, that's fine.
-You're my friend, and I'm happy for you.
-Oh, thank you.
Plus I don't know how you're gonna
screw it up, but I know you will.
What's there to screw up?
She just wants to keep things casual.
Oh, great,
that's how you're gonna screw it up.
Hey, I can be casual.
Mm-hm. I should get a haircut.
This thing's going south fast.
So Ruchi and I decided
to keep things casual.
[SCOFFS]
Wait-- What, I can handle casual.
[SCOFFS]
-Why do you keep doing that with your face?
-You keep saying stupid things with yours.
Okay, fine, I'm not great at casual relationships,
and I don't wanna scare her off.
Just give her some space, all right?
Don't call, text, e-mail.
That's crazy. What if I see a sunset
that reminds me of her?
-When do you see her next?
-We're having dinner tonight.
Okay, put a rubber band around your wrist.
Any time you start planning your wedding
or naming your children...
...I want you to stab yourself in the hand
with a fork.
-What's the rubber band for?
-To slow the bleeding.
Hey, how's Bernadette handling bed rest?
Well, she lies around all day
eating Mallomars and hollering at me...
...so her transformation from my wife
to my mother is complete.
Congratulations.
I know that's what you were hoping for.
Sheldon, you left your jacket
in my office last night.
No-- No, I didn't. That's not my jacket.
Then why does it say
""Property of S. Cooper. Stop touching it""?
Sounds like someone named Scooper
doesn't want you touching his jacket.
Are you guys working together
on that meteorite project?
Yes, fine, you found me out.
I'm doing geology.
Just please don't tell anyone.
Are you embarrassed of me?
Oh, no, no, no, not you.
No, just the work
that you've devoted your entire life to.
If you're ashamed to be working with me,
I don't wanna work with you.
Sheldon, that was pretty rude.
Well, what do you expect?
He's a geologist.
-This place seems nice.
-But not too nice.
Yelp called it good for groups.
-Would you care to buy the lady--?
-Get out of here.
Sorry about that. I hate when someone
assumes two people are dating...
...just because they look like
they would make beautiful babies together.
Are you sure you're okay with this?
Honestly, Ruchi, I don't have a lot
of experience with casual relationships.
I have some experience
with serious relationships...
...and a ton of experience
with no relationships.
-You're funny.
-I'm glad it came off that way.
So tell me about your day.
How's work going?
Well, I spent the morning
reviewing side effects for our fungal cream...
...so it was a lot of ooze and pus.
And then I had to catalogue it...
...by color, viscosity...
...and percentage of blood.
Sounds wonderful.
Hey.
What you got there?
A rock.
Did some mean boys throw it at you?
It turns out I'm the mean boy.
Although I did drop it on my own foot,
so kind of.
What's going on?
What if there was something I wanted to do...
...but I was worried other people
would think less of me?
Is that other person me? Does it happen in the
bedroom? In which case, I'm cool with it.
No.
It's about working with Bert--
You know what? I'm not even gonna say it.
I'm just gonna say the letter it starts with
and ""ology.""
G-- Oh, no, that's not gonna work.
-Geology?
-Yes.
But we parted ways
because I was worried about my reputation.
Sheldon, you've never cared
what people thought.
Even when you really, really should.
That dinner with my parents
comes to mind.
If I'm not gonna use ""your mama"" jokes
when I meet your mother...
...why did I bother to learn them?
I'm just saying,
if you think the work is interesting...
...nothing else should matter.
You're right, Amy.
That is sage advice.
Which is surprising,
considering your mama is so dumb--
Nope.
--she studied for a urine test.
I was supposed to go back to India
and get married.
But I realized it wasn't what I wanted.
So I called off the engagement
and moved here.
If he wasn't your soulmate,
he wasn't your soulmate.
Oh, God.
Please tell me you're not one of those.
One of what?
I wanna say teenage girls,
but that sounds mean.
Come on. You don't believe
that everyone has one perfect match?
Of course not. That's ridiculous.
I mean, what if your soulmate lived halfway
across the world? You'd never meet.
Yes, you would. I can give you 20 examples
where that happened to Kate Hudson.
Know what? People get upset when I talk
about this. Let's change the subject.
No, no, no. No, it's fine.
Are you saying that you don't believe
two people fall in love?
They do. It's just that what people
call love is actually a series...
...of biochemical reactions in the brain
that fade over time.
Ah. Yes. Like the old song ""When a Man
Has a Biochemical Reaction For a Woman.""
We're scientists.
We don't need to feel threatened...
...just because we understand the mechanisms
that give rise to romantic feelings.
It doesn't take anything away
from the experience.
Yes, it does.
Actually, it takes everything away from it.
Love isn't just science, okay?
It's spiritual.
It's an acknowledgment
of a mystery greater than ourselves.
It's what makes people
write songs and poems...
...and what has kept
The Bachelor
on TV for 21 magical seasons.
Don't you think the fact that love
is given away as a prize on a game show...
...undermines your argument?
Yes, but I've never missed an episode,
and I dare science to explain that.
Bert?
Bert, Bert?
Bert, Bert, Bert.
What do you want, Sheldon?
I would like us to work together again.
And I promise to keep
my geology comments to myself.
Because while some of them are funny,
all of them are mean.
Ah. This is awkward.
Leonard, what are you doing here?
Bert asked for my help.
Yeah, he's an excellent scientist...
...and he doesn't tell me
what time I can go to the bathroom.
It's called bladder training.
When you're in your 80s,
you'll thank me for it.
Look, Sheldon, you were a jerk to Bert,
and he walked away from you...
...so I feel like there's a lot
he could teach me.
Bert, please.
I know I behaved poorly in the past,
but things will be different this time. You'll see.
Come on, let me in.
We'll have some laughs,
we'll calculate some isotope ratios....
I'm sorry, Sheldon.
[DOOR CLOSES]
So you just shut the door in his face?
I gotta start writing this stuff down.
I mean, Ruchi is nice.
We're just so different.
Sometimes when you're dating,
you meet weird people.
I once met a girl who didn't like juggling.
And she still doesn't.
So you're not gonna see her again?
What's the point?
We're never gonna be in a real relationship.
-So you'll only be in a physical one?
-Exactly.
-Why spend time with someone like that?
-Someone who is just interested in sex?
Yeah.
-Raj, do you really--?
-Hold on. Give him a chance. He'll get this.
I don't think he is.
What is there to get?
She doesn't want to fall in love.
At that point, all we are
is two single people...
...who find each other attractive
and enjoy having-- Oh, gotta go.
-So how was your night with Ruchi?
-Great.
We ordered in some food,
we had sex, I left.
-I didn't even ask if she enjoyed it.
-Heh. Oh, I can field that one for her.
I did get a little misty when we said goodbye.
I played it off as allergies.
-I don't know if she bought it.
-Again, I know.
Sheldon?
You okay? Sheldon."
s12ep14.xml,"Ooh, it's freezing
out here.
Would you like me to...
heat things up?
No, I want to get in the hot tub
before I lose a toe.
Oh. That is bright!
Yeah, a new neighbor
put in floodlights.
Huh.
So, shall we?
No. I don't want
to take my robe off
under a spotlight.
This is a candle body.
MAN (calls):
Howdy, neighbors!
We haven't met
yet. I'm Andy.
Oh. Hello.
Nice to meet you.
You know, your new balcony kind
of looks right over our fence.
ANDY:
You might want to put up some
trees. We can see everything.
You
can,
but it's okay
if you don't.
So, can you turn
your lights off?
Sorry, they're
motion-sensored.
They'll go off in a minute.
Just try to stay still.
(door closes)
What are we gonna
do about this?
I say we wait until
his lights go off,
and then I make hot,
motionless love to you.
Don't move.
It's go time.

And his new balcony looks
right down on our hot tub,
which meant we
couldn't do anything.
So you gave your kids
Benadryl for nothing?
Why do I share with you?
You're such a yenta.
Are we done talking about
Howard's failed
conjugal relations?
I have an actual
Nobel Prize crisis to deal with.
Has anything changed since the
last time you talked about it?
No.
Is there anything
you can do about it?
No.
Then shut up
or go wait in the car!
LEONARD:
Excuse me.
Remember you all came here
to check out
my cool new laser?
Oh, right. I'm gonna go
wait in the car.
The best part is that
it's europium-based, so...
And then Andy said
if we want privacy,
we should plant
some trees.
The only way I know how to
do that is to give a dollar
and a tree shows
up in Israel.
Okay. Anyway, so because
it's europium-based...
Hey. I need some help
with a meteorite I found.
Ah. I'd be happy to.
Oh, no, I meant Raj.
I really need an astrophysicist.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Wow.
This is exactly like
a dream I had.
Except in the dream,
you're Gal Gadot.
I don't really have dreams,
when I sleep or in life.
Anyway...
I X-rayed this meteorite,
and it looks like there's
some sort of organic signature
inside of it,
but I could really use
another opinion.
Well, great.
Let's go check it out.
LEONARD:
Cool.
I'm gonna stay here
and show Howard...
I want to see it!
Okay. Well, thanks for
stopping by.
(electrical humming)
Screw them. That's cool.
Hey, I'm not sure
we're in the right line.
Is this for
the city zoning office?
Yes, it is.
Or, as we call it here,
""the zone zone.""
(chuckles)
WOMAN (calls):
No, we don't.
That's Linda.
Ignore her.
She's going through the change.
Now, how can I help you?
Our neighbor built
a balcony that looks
right into our backyard,
and we're trying to see
if there's anything
we can do about it.
Well, you have come
to the right place.
You know, a lot of people handle
this type of thing online,
but I always say
nothing beats the human touch.
(chuckles)
Oh, but don't worry.
I'm not gonna
actually touch you.
We had quite the informative
meeting on that.
We just want a little
privacy in our backyard.
You know, for...
(clicks tongue)
(quietly): Maybe we should've
done this online.
No, no, no, no.
The zone zone is a safe zone.
LINDA:
Stop saying ""zone zone""!
So, is there anything we can do?
Absolutely. Do you know if they
have permits for the balcony?
Oh, no. We were hoping
you could check.
I certainly can. I just
need you to fill out a form,
and we have them available
in Armenian, Chinese,
Cambodian, English, Farsi,
Korean, Spanish and Vietnamese.
Well, English, obviously.
Well, we're not
allowed to presume.
That was a whole other meeting.
So we just fill out
the form and that's it?
Oh, no. No, you need to
fill it out, and then you need
to bring it down to
the Office of Code Compliance.
Now, if your neighbors don't
have a permit, you can file
an official complaint,
but if they do have a permit,
then you have to make the case
that the balcony constitutes
a nuisance, an encumbrance
or an encroachment,
and you have to decide which,
because they are three
totally separate forms.
This is starting to seem like
more trouble than it's worth.
I know, right? (chuckles)
(sneezes)
You okay?
Yeah.
Great, 'cause you just bought
that whole row of Batmans.
Sorry, I...
(sneezes)
And now you bought Aquaman.
Good choice.
If you want cold medicine,
Stuart has the entire run
of DayQuils,
including the rare
""DayQuilt"" misprint from 1996.
What can I say?
I'm a collector.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
I think it's just allergies.
Hi, guys.
Hey.
LEONARD: Hey.
Oh, heads up.
If that Aquaman feels wet,
it's not a gimmick.
Leonard sneezed on it.
You sick?
Uh, it's just allergies.
Oh. So, check it out.
This meteorite that Bert found
is really cool.
We did a spectrographic
analysis, and there's...
there's definitely something
going on inside.
Well, hey, i-if you want,
we could use my new laser
to cut it open.
Well, thanks, but Bert's
got this water-cooled,
diamond-bladed saw.
Well, sure, but with my laser,
you'd get a thinner slice,
which would make for
a better sample.
STUART: Whoa, whoa.
You're not gonna cut
open a meteor, are you?
Have you not learned anything
from comic books?
Space viruses?
Pod people?
I sell nothing
but warnings.
C-Calm down, Stuart.
You're being a little crazy.
Oh, is he?
Is he being crazy?
Or is he the only one around
here who's making any sense?
It's nice they
found each other.
Yeah. Uh, so, anyway,
you want to use my laser?
Eh, sorry.
It's kind of Bert's thing,
and he wants to do it
his way, so...
Okay.
Yeah, that's cool.
Just seems dumb
to not use the laser.
Not as dumb as
unleashing a plague on mankind,
but, hey, what do we know?
Literally nothing.
We spent half the day down
at the city planning office,
and didn't solve a thing.
Now we have to go
back tomorrow.
The planning office?
You lucky ducks.
Yeah, this one made
me go for ice cream
and talk about her day.
Spoiler alert:
it was fine.
It
wasn't
fine.
I got trapped in an elevator.
I may have missed a few details.
The bottom of my cone
was drippy.
So now we have to download
all these forms
and fill them out.
SHELDON:
We get it.
Your life is great.
Stop rubbing it in.
Yeah, quit it.
SHELDON:
Is one of the forms
the 599B/C?
Because, if so, it has
a doozy of a typo.
I don't know.
All right, well, I don't
want to spoil anything,
but you might want to start
practicing your ""siglature.""
Sheldon, if you like this
stuff, why don't you come
and do it with us?
Or instead of us?
(gasps)
Do you mean it?
No, no, wait, it's too late.
You can't take it back. Yes.
Well, Amy,
looks like the elevator
might have been
the high point of your day.
Hey, where's Raj?
Uh, he's working with Bert.
They're probably cutting
their stupid meteorite open
with their stupid
diamond saw.
(blows nose)
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm just a little run-down.
It might be a head cold.
Purell.
Purell.
Purell.
Purell.
Can I top anybody off?
It's just so frustrating.
I-I know my laser would be
way more efficient.
They're gonna lose so much
meteorite due to kerf loss.
Mm. I'm sorry your friends won't
let you play kerf with them.
Don't make it sound childish.
It's the scientific word
for dust.
What was wrong with ""dust""?
Are you sure you're
not just a little jealous?
No. It's just, my way is better,
but they won't even consider it.
Oh, well, it's their loss.
Look, why don't you go to bed.
I'll run out and get
you some medicine.
Ah, it's okay.
Stuart gave me some when
I was at the comic book store.
Really? You're taking medicine
from Stuart?
Doesn't he need,
like, all of it?
Mm, he's got plenty.
His pill caddy is,
like, this big.
All right, well,
why don't you go to bed.
I'll sleep out here
on the couch.
No, no, no, you take the bed.
I'll stay out here.
Even better.
Sweet dreams, snot bag.
See what
I'm talking about?
Oh, yes.
Oh, that is
textbook encroachment.
And I know
because I have the textbook.
First edition.
Watch what happens
when you move.
Oh!
Oh, boy, you weren't kidding.
Oh, those are 10,000
lumens if they're a lumen.
Well, you know
what they say:
when life give you lumens,
make lumen-ade. (chuckles)
Was that a joke?
Yes.
Based on the premise that
""lumen"" sounds like ""lemon""?
Yes.
(chuckles):
That's hilarious.
Okay, what is the setback
on property lines
in this neighborhood?
Oh, I don't know.
It must be on the permit
from when you built your deck.
Uh, yeah,
my dad built this.
We didn't do
the whole permit thing.
Here we go.
Are you saying
I'm standing
on an unpermitted deck?
It's been here for years,
Sheldon. It's fine.
How did the inspector
not flag this
when he came to check out
your bathroom renovation?
Uh...
(grunts)
Are you telling me
that I have showered
in an uninspected bathroom?
You showered
in our house?
You made me hold your children.
What did you expect me to do?
(exhales)
You think
you know people.
You
do
know
them, Sheldon.
Yeah, but-but do we?
Do we
really
know them?
Yes!
They're rule breakers, Amy.
And you know what we do
with rule breakers?
Complain about them
to our spouse
until she's ready to drive
into oncoming traffic?
You can't cross
a double yellow line.
What is this, the Purge?
So, I guess
you're not gonna help them?
Oh, I'm gonna help them--
help them get on the right side
of Johnny Law.
Oh, you can't
turn them in.
The city's gonna
make them rip out
all the work they've
done and do it over.
It would be the end
of your friendship.
What choice do I have?
These are the rules.
Sheldon, I am begging you.
Please, don't do this.
You know who doesn't get permits
for their decks? Animals.
Animals don't have decks.
Oh, really? I have
one word for you: beavers.
(blows nose)
(sniffles)
Bert?
Raj?
(sniffles)
Huh.
Can't believe
they're gonna cut that
with this punk-ass diamond saw.
Geez.
Oh, hey, look.
""Siglature.""
Next!
Hello.
Hi! Welcome to the zone zone.
(chuckles)
(chuckles):
Oh, that's funny!
Hey, I also have
a joke for you.
Lumen-ade.
Maybe I told it wrong.
Well, how can I help you?
If I know someone in violation
of the building code,
should I turn them in?
Interesting question.
Yeah, I know. Because,
on the one hand,
Confucius says we owe
a greater responsibility
to people we're close with
rather than to society at large.
But, on the other hand,
Socrates says that
we're obligated to obey
all laws, even unjust ones.
And then, furthermore,
if we're entertaining rules
about when it's okay
to break the rules,
I should--
where does it end?
Well, for me, it ends at 5:00.
Well, I just-- I don't
know what to do.
All I can tell you
is that the building codes
are there for everyone's safety.
Oh, so you're saying I have
no choice but to turn them in.
I did not say that.
But would you?
And remember that I laughed
at your ""zone zone"" joke.
LINDA:
It's not even a joke!
Oh, is that Linda back there?
Yeah.
Aw.
How are her hot
flashes? Any better?
(mouths)
Leonard,
what are you doing?!
Showing you that this
is the better way.
Stop! Whatever's
inside there is dangerous!
(zapping)
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Oh.
And pretty.
What is that?
(gas hisses, Leonard shouts)
Are you okay?
(groans)
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just feeling a little...
(distorted):
...hungry.
(screaming)
Stop eating Bert!
Keep eating Bert!
(screaming)
PENNY:
Leonard.
Leonard!
What? What?
You're having a bad dream.
Oh, thank God.
I was eating my friends.
Well, one friend
and one acquaintance.
You know what, Bert's okay.
Two friends.
Let me see
if you're running a fever.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah,
you're burning up.
(screaming)
(screams)
Geez!
Are you okay?
(pants)
That depends.
What-what color are my eyes?
I don't know, brown?
No, green. No, wait, brown.
Oh, good, I'm awake.
Howie, someone's here
to see you.
Hello.
Hey. What's going on?
Can you come
over here?
Sheldon, the deck is safe.
You can walk on it.
(sighs)
(exhales)
Oh, that gets the heart going.
Mm.
So, what's up?
I went down to the city
Code Compliance Office
to turn you in.
Are you kidding?
But I didn't do it.
I filled out the form
and then realized
that the unwritten rules
of friendship
are more important
than the written rules
of the city of Altadena's
Zoning and Planning Department.
Aw.
Really? ""Aw""?
And you'll be happy to know
that, while I was there,
I did look into
your neighbor's balcony,
and it is encroaching
on your property line.
I had all this pent-up
snitch energy,
so I reported him hard.
What did they say?
He's going
to have to remove it.
(chuckles)
So the good guys win?
Well, I don't know
if I'd call you the good guys.
You're enforcing a law on him
that you're willfully ignoring
yourselves.
Uh, all right, fine.
So the morally
compromised guys win.
Apparently so.
Now, if one of you'd be
kind enough to take me home,
I need to use my bathroom.
What's wrong
with the one here?
I'm sorry, I want to live.
(sniffles)
Hey. You guys
got a second?
Leonard, I told you, buddy.
We don't need to use your laser.
Yeah, all we need
is Terry Brad-saw.
That's what I named my saw.
No, I-I just wanted
to apologize for yesterday.
I just-- I think
I was jealous, you know?
Sheldon and Amy
might win a Nobel Prize,
and now you guys have
this cool meteorite project.
Really? You're
jealous of us?
Yeah.
I even had this crazy dream
last night where I ate you both.
Seriously?
Uh...
I know. I was pretty out of it.
Who'd you eat first?
Oh. Uh, you.
(chuckles) Nice.
(jackhammer rattling)
This is just delightful.
Do you think he knows we're the
ones that got him in trouble?
Who cares?
I do. I met his wife.
She seems really nice.
ANDY: Sorry about
the noise, neighbor!
No problem!
Hey, you guys know
a Sheldon Cooper?!
No, we do not!
Is it just me or has no one
been in the store for hours?
Yeah, it is weirdly quiet.
(gasps)
Nobody's in the street.
Huh. Well,
that's strange.
You thinking
what I'm thinking?
They cut that meteorite open
and unleashed a space plague?
Exactly.
Let me just lock up here.
(lock clicks)
Okay. So what do we do?
Uh, well, if this is
a worst-case scenario
and we're the last two
people alive, we're gonna,
we're gonna have to
rebuild civilization.
Do you have
any special skills?
I can draw.
How 'bout you?
I can play clarinet.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Yeah, ten years.
Ah.
You know, it, uh,
might also be up to us to
repopulate the Earth.
I'm okay with that.
(chuckles)
So... shall we?
Wait here. I'm gonna
brush my teeth.
Sorry, we're closed!
This is going on Yelp!"

Agreed, although
I did have
a pretty awesome bachelor party

Really? What was it?
Well, I used my NASA connections
to get us four seats
on that plane
that lets you experience
weightlessness.
The Vomit Comet.
That is so cool.
I've always wanted
to experience weightlessness.
The closest I ever came
was that time
I accidentally set my scale
to kilograms.

been fun, but, hey,

would you want me to tell you?

I'll bring Anu,
Bernie would like it.
I'm not sure
Maybe I'll invite

Oh, go with Bert!
SHELDON:
He's huge. It'd be fun to
watch him float around.
Like that time the
Underdog balloon
got away at the
Macy's Parade.
Hey. What are those?
Oh, vitamins.
Zack wants me to take them
to increase my virility.
Zack used the word ""virility""?

""wiener power.""

I don't want you to go
and ruin it for everyone.
Which is a long way of saying
I want you to go!
(quietly): I think this is
going pretty good, huh?
You threw me under the bus.
Maybe for you.
Oh, I'm sorry. I panicked.

Well, yeah, now he's judging me.
I know. It worked.

In high school, he could
under a blanket.
in my closet
So let me get this
straight, Leonard.
to have your baby,
She doesn't want
ex-boyfriend does.
but her dumbbell
Well, I-- no, I wouldn't
say it like that.
How would you say it?
(sighs)
Uh, same words, just less angry.
Well, I don't know
about Los Angeles,
that's kind of strange.
but in Nebraska,
and we have a bakery for dogs.
It's strange here, too,
And you're okay with this?
I support my husband.
Thank you.
But, you know,
if you think differently,
you should feel free
to say so.
You know, just like, ""Ah!""
Make a scene.
have kids of their own,
Okay, look, they can't
that I'm smart,
and they like
and they want that
for their child.
No, I get it.
You do?
Sure.
we had a prize stallion.
Back on the farm,
We didn't let that just go to
waste; we put him out to stud.
No, no, this is... this is
a little different than that...
hey, hey, hey, hey.
No, no, hey, hey,
Uh, you were comparing me
to a prize stud. Go on.
You have fun with
your new best buddy?
Hey, it's your fault
your dad likes me.
You dated idiots
your whole life.
Well, he was right
about one thing.
(chuckles)
I am married to a stud.
Mm. Really?
about selling you out,
Yeah, I felt so bad
maybe make it up to you.
I thought I would
(both chuckle)
(moans)
Wait, wait. I can't.
(stammers)
I mean, I want to,
but I'm not supposed to
for the next three days.
I forgot. (groans)
Oh. That's right.
I'll just read a little
All right, well, guess
know-- go to sleep.
and then-- I don't
Really? That's what
you're sleeping in?
Oh, you want me to take it off?
No.
All right.
and let me read my comic book.
Well, then pipe down
Penny, I-I know
what you're doing.
Just please stop.
Ooh, listen to this.
""Bam.
""Pow.
Take that, Batman.""
doing this, guys.
Thanks again for
So excited.
Of course.
I'm glad you came.
this wasn't your kind of thing.
Howard made it sound like
He did say that, but here I am.
So what does he know?
I'm sorry. I just...
(scoffs)
didn't think you'd enjoy
plummeting to the Earth
at 400 miles an hour.
I love going fast,
unlike Grandma here,
poking along
at 70 miles an hour.
Am I right?
I've always wanted
to do this.
I'm an adrenaline junkie.
Roller coasters, snowboarding,
who bathe with their dogs.
dating men
It was during a drought.
I'm a thrill-seeker, too.
I've had to pull back
since I became a mom,
but I'll still jump on the back
of a grocery cart
through the meat section.
and just roll
And I'm married
to her,
which is quite
the ride.
(exhales)
(sputters)
(clinking)
Amy?
Yeah?
There's something out here.
Just trap it
under a cup,
and I'll be there
in a minute.
I'll try, but
it's Leonard.
What?
(grunts)
he doing here?
Well, what is
I told you, if we left
pizza on the counter,
we'd attract
something.
Oh, hey, guys.
Sorry. I used my key.
I just needed
a place to crash.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I...
had to get out of the apartment.
My wife kept trying
to have sex with me.
Been there.
to avoid having sex?
Why are you trying
Well, we just did it
three weeks ago.
I was talking
to Leonard!
Well, I-I have to go
to the clinic
for Zack and Marissa on Monday,
to save myself until then.
and I'm supposed
totally on board with that plan.
Sounds like maybe Penny's not
Well, she said she was.
But she also said
I looked dope.
Honestly, I don't even
think I looked fly.
to go through with this,
So you're willing
she clearly has reservations?
even though
If she has a problem,
she should say something.
She tried to seduce you.
If that's not a cry for help,
I don't know what is.
Penny doesn't want
to have kids.
I respect that.
leave a part of me behind.
But this is my chance to
Okay, but this isn't
gonna make you a dad.
It's gonna be
their baby, not yours.
Although,
someday,
to know why he's short,
if that kid wants
nearsighted, and asthmatic...
...he may hunt you down.
Are you guys ready for the most
intense experience of your life?
Definitely.
Yes.
I'm an astronaut,
Not to brag, but
weightless before.
so I've been
Can be pretty scary.
Please, I'm, like, 90 pounds.
I hold more than three balloons.
I'm weightless every time
Okay, I just need you guys
to sign these waivers,
and then you
can go get changed.
There are a lot
of pages here.
Is this a waiver or a screenplay
you've been working on?
I'm sure it's just
boilerplate.
Absolutely. It's to protect us
in case of injury.
It says, ""Or death.""
Which is awesome.
changing rooms?
Where are the
Done.
Dressing rooms
are in the back.
No peeking.
Here you go.
Okay. Should we go get changed?
Yeah. Hang on a second.
What?
I have two babies at home.
Just--
What am I doing?
If you don't want to do this,
then why'd you come?
that he doesn't know me as well
To prove to Howard
as he thinks he does.
Looks like he does.
and then he doesn't.
Unless I do it
Why not just be honest?
You're right.
(sighs)
I should be honest.
You owe me $3,000 for those
plane tickets to India!
(cheering on TV)
(sighs)
Hey.
That was a long run.
Yeah. Well,
I was in the zone.
You know,
and then in a diner
at the mall where I fell asleep.
and then in a massage chair
Are you avoiding me?
next to Hot Dog on a Stick.
Well, I took a nap
What do you think?
I think you're mad at me
and Leonard,
but maybe... you're really mad
at yourself.
Why would I be
mad at myself?
'Cause you regret
this ""no baby"" plan of yours.
pretty crappy of you
You know, it's
to make me feel
bad about this.
I'm not trying
to make you feel bad.
But... do you?
Yes.
letting everybody down.
I feel like I'm
Hate disappointing Leonard,
disappointing you.
but I really hate
Oh, Slugger, you could
never disappoint me.
Okay, your high school years
were a little rough.
And I'm sorry about that.
There was you
sneaking out at night
and your boyfriends
sneaking out in the morning.
I said sorry.
That time you got drunk
and stole a horse.
Yeah.
I was there.
I remember.
Parts of it.
But besides all that,
being your dad is the best thing
ever happened to me.
Randall and Lisa?
What about
They're okay.
I just don't want you
to miss out.
I know.
But if this is
really what you want--
or don't want--
I'm on your side.
Thanks.
(door opens)
Hey.
Hey.
Uh, Wyatt, we need to talk.
Sure. What's up?
I want you to back off.
You know? I-If Penny and I don't
have kids, that's between us.
So you need
to stay out of it.
Oh, Leonard, it's okay.
We talked. We're good.
Oh.
Okay, you could've
stopped me sooner.
Could've let
you go longer.
Uh-huh.
You did great, Leonard.
Very forceful.
(chuckles)
Yeah?
was a little shaky there.
I-I-I felt like my voice
Um...
to not go through
Hey, I decided
and Marissa thing.
with this Zack
Really?
But you were
so excited about it.
I know.
But, um...
I think I was just
fooling myself.
I-I would be heartbroken
if I had a kid out there
and I wasn't his dad.
I know you would.
(clicks tongue)
Yeah.
(inhales deeply)
you wanted to do last night,
(quietly): So, that thing
I'm available.
I got real good hearing there,
stud.
All right,
everyone's suited up.
Let's head out
to the tarmac!
Actually, one second.
Howie, I don't think
I should do this.
Really?
Well, I did
not see that coming.
Just-- We have kids,
put us both in danger.
and it's not smart to
That's a good point.
When I was little,
my parents
never flew together.
We thought it was
because they loved us,
they hated each other.
but it turns out
See?
I shouldn't go.
I just think
Actually, this is much safer
than driving a car.
Stay out of it, flyboy!
You're right.
(chuckles)
But I've done this before.
And since you really,
really want to go,
I'll stay here.
Oh. Great.
Unless you don't want to because
I was right and I do know you.
then you know how far I'll go
Well, if you really know me,
Apparently,
to prove a point.
34,000 feet that way,
then straight back down,
up and down,
over and over again
until you throw up food
you didn't even eat.
They are definitely
your weirdest friends.
If only that were true.
(screaming)
I hate this so much!
Why am I doing this?!
To prove a stupid point
to your husband!
Oh, right. Worth it.
Hey, Zack.
Um, look, I-I know this
is gonna be disappointing,
but, um, I-I can't do this.
No, no, no, no.
I-I, I know
how.
I just can't.
But, hey, look,
(stammers)
i-if you like,
who might be interested.
I-I know someone
No! Absolutely not!
my wife says I'm not allowed.
I'm sorry,"
s11ep6.xml,"-Howie, slow down.
-I can't.
I'm not allowed to eat for 12 hours before
my surgery, and I've only got two more minutes.
What surgery are you having?
I'm stress-eating.
My best friend's getting
a vasectomy tomorrow.
And you're sad you won't be able
to bear his child?
Oh, my goodness.
If it's ""vasectomy gone wrong"" videos,
he's seen them all.
Including the one of the guy who's sitting
on what appears to be a cantaloupe, but is not.
And I'm done.
They're going to start making
Professor Proton's Science Show
again.
-I thought he passed away.
-He did.
He was cremated, and his remains were put
in a baking-soda volcano.
-Don't make jokes. He meant a lot to Sheldon.
-Me too. I grew up watching his show.
-He's one of the reasons I became a scientist.
-Aww. I thought you did it just to get girls.
Joke's on you. It worked.
-Have they found anyone to replace him?
-Not yet, and it won't be easy.
Arthur Jeffries was
an accomplished scientist.
You know who would make
a great Professor Proton? Meryl Streep.
She's not a scientist.
Well, then explain to me
why she has chemistry with literally everyone.
It would be nice if they cast a woman.
You've already got
Doctor Who
and
The Ghostbusters.
Leave us something.
-Who do you think it should be?
-It should be a scientist I respect, you know.
Someone with a pleasing voice
and symmetrical facial features.
Is he talking about himself?
If he's talking, he's talking about himself.
I just know how much
Professor Proton touched me as a child...
...and I feel that I owe it to him to try
and touch as many children as possible.
You should put that on your audition tape.
-You doing okay?
-No, I'm very nervous.
[GROANING]
-Where are you going?
-Gift shop.
There is no gift shop. Sit down.
This was your idea.
So was having sex,
and look where that got us.
This isn't a big deal. Stop whining.
When you were in labor and I said that,
you kicked me.
Howard Wolowitz.
-Want me to go with you?
-No, I'll be fine.
Yeah, we got this.
Sit down.
Wish me luck.
Other way, buster.
Okay. You ready?
Almost. I'm working on my facial expressions.
See, I've got interested. Hmm.
I've got very interested. Hmm....
And enraged.
Why would you be enraged?
Better to have it and not need it
than to need it and not have it.
Okay.
And rolling.
Hello, I am theoretical physicist
Dr. Sheldon Cooper...
...auditioning for the role of Professor Proton.
Now, excuse me while I get into character.
Hello, I'm Professor Proton.
And today, boys and girls,
we're going to have fun with science.
Did you know you could calculate the mass
of an electron using household items?
It's true. All you'll need is a pencil,
some paper, dry ice, rubbing alcohol...
...and a spool
of 50-micron-thick cobalt-60 wire.
And remember, don't put it in your mouth...
...or instead of becoming a scientist,
you'll become wildly radioactive.
Hang on, I have a question.
Do you have any experiments
that aren't life-threatening?
Come on, that was a perfect take
and you ruined it.
Oh, look, hey, I did need enraged.
Ow, ow, ow.
Really hurts, huh?
No, he's just saying,
""Ow can these prices be so low?""
It's gonna be okay.
A day or two of rest, and you'll be fine.
You know nothing about Jewish people.
[HALLEY BABBLING OVER MONITOR]
Let me go check on her.
Okay, this is a bit awkward.
It says here that I need to check the area
for redness and swelling.
You know what? It hurts so much, go ahead.
So you see, boys and girls, H, or helicity...
...is the natural variable to use relativistically...
...and is defined as S-dot-P,
divided by the magnitude of P.
So next time someone on the playground
tells you, you can only use integral values...
...for the matrix that determines
the spin of the antiproton...
...you stop being friends with that kid,
because he's going nowhere.
Until next week, this is Professor Proton
saying 01000010...
...01111001...
...01100101.
That's ""bye"" in ASCII binary.
Or good-binary.
[CHUCKLES]
So, what do you think?
Well, I already told him that I loved it,
but if you found it confusing or dangerous...
...or, I don't know,
three to four times too long...
...now's the time to share.
I-- I don't know what to say.
Leonard, do you know what to say?
Sheldon, I thought it--
It looked like you were having so much fun.
Hey, that's what you used to tell me to say
to Penny after one of her terrible plays.
-Hey.
-Hey!
Well, what was wrong with it, you know?
Did you find it borderline psychotic?
I mean, I liked that about it,
but you guys discuss.
Do remember when you were a kid
and you'd watch Professor Proton?
-Of course.
-Well, did he ever make you...
...I don't know, hate science
and the people who do it?
What are you saying?
I just think it would be better...
...if your contempt for children
wasn't so much in the foreground.
You want me to lie?
Look, it's not lying, it's acting.
Sheldon Cooper may not like kids,
but Professor Proton loves them.
Interesting. You know,
I hadn't really thought of it that way.
It's similar to how I'm afraid of dogs,
but my D&D character likes dogs.
But he's allergic, so he can't be around them.
Why don't we have a dog?
-Hey, you can always reshoot it.
-I suppose.
Maybe I could even get some tips
from someone who's acted professionally.
Well, Sheldon, obviously,
I'd be happy to help you out.
I don't know what to say.
-Hey, Sheldon, what's up?
-I need an acting coach.
-Would you give me Patrick Stewart's number?
-No.
Fine, I guess you can do it.
[BELL RINGING]
HOWARD:
Bernie.
Where did you get a bell?
App store.
Fun. Let me see.
When you can catch me,
you can have it back.
You wanna lie down, watch a movie?
I can't. I got my 16-week checkup to get to.
And then I'll pick up some Chinese for dinner.
I'll take Halley with me.
-You sure you're not overdoing it?
-No, it's fine.
Great, then maybe instead of Chinese, fire up
the grill and throw on a couple of steaks?
Kung pao chicken, please.
-Oh, boy.
-What?
They cast the new Professor Proton.
-Is it Sheldon?
-Not exactly.
SHELDON:
Wheaton!
It's Wil Wheaton.
-Hi.
-Hey.
How was the doctor?
Good, but I have some news.
Don't say twins,
don't say twins, don't say twins.
It's not twins.
Because I would've loved them both.
The doctor said I was overdoing it,
so she put me on bed rest, just to be safe.
Oh, no.
It may not look like it, but I'm running to you.
Hello, Arthur.
What part of ""rest in peace""
don't you understand?
I suppose you're here
because you heard the news.
Sheldon, I'm a figment of your imagination.
I don't hear news.
You're a grumpy figment.
Look, they're remaking your show...
...and they cast Wil Wheaton
as Professor Proton.
And the worst part is,
he's not even a scientist.
No, the worst part is,
I'm sitting on a moist log.
We have to stop this and protect your legacy.
What legacy?
My last two seasons,
I was on Sunday morning at 5:30.
We were beat by
Davey and Goliath.
I can't believe you don't care.
Believe it.
Well, I care a lot.
And Wil Wheaton will rue the day
he ever met me.
I think that's true of most people.
[KNOCKS]
Hi, guys, wanna check in
and see how you two were doing.
We're okay.
Yeah, hanging out in bed with my wife,
thawing out some frozen peas in my pants.
Living the dream.
[HALLEY CRYING OVER MONITOR]
-Oh, I'll get her.
-But I thought Raj was helping you out.
No, he had to work.
Plus he has a quota for the amount
of Indian servant jokes he can tolerate...
...and apparently I filled it.
Well, hey, I can get the baby.
No, Howie's got it. He's fine. Right, Howie?
[GRUNTING]
Never better.
Don't be silly. I'll take the rest of the day off
and watch Halley for you.
Or we can call Stuart.
I'm sure he could close up the store,
hop on a bus, and be here in no time.
He does love the bus.
Okay, hang on. Do you guys not trust me
to take care of your baby?
-No.
-No.
-No.
-No.
So I guess....
No.
-Wow.
-It's not that we don't trust you...
... it's just,
you don't seem like much of a baby person.
Hey, hey, hey,
I can watch your stupid baby, okay?
If she cries, I will pick her up.
If she's hungry, I'll give her a bottle...
...and if she poops, I'll light some incense.
It would be a big help.
-Okay, thank you.
-Trust me, you have nothing to worry about.
Back in Nebraska, I raised all our baby pigs,
right until the day they were slaughtered.
So unless your baby's made
of breakfast meat, she's fine.
Would you ever get a vasectomy?
Ugh. In case you haven't noticed,
Indians aren't too big on birth control.
There's probably like a million more of us
since we started this conversation.
[SHELDON GROANS]
-You okay?
-No.
No, all these comments online about Wil,
they're nothing but supportive and kind.
Where's the mean, snarky Internet
that shows up every time I get a haircut?
You know that's us, right?
[LAUGHS]
Well, luckily, I got the number of the company
who's trying to reboot the show.
So I need you all to call
and register your displeasure.
-Sheldon, no one's gonna do that.
-Not true.
I know of three calls they've received already.
A Southern gentleman...
...a cockney chimney sweep...
...and Mr. T. Hmm.
Who, spoiler alert, pities the fool
who tries to reboot that show.
What about tiresome lunatic
with a bad haircut? Has he called yet?
Come on, how many times
have we banded together...
...to try to save a show that we loved?
Let's shake things up and try to kill one.
Isn't the important thing that there's a show
to get kids excited about science?
Who cares about kids and what they like?
This is about me and something I liked
when I was a kid.
-What if the reboot is great?
-That's even worse.
If I like it, I'll feel like
I'm being disloyal to Arthur.
He was a mentor and a friend...
...and I won't toss him aside for some
Hollywood pretty boy like Wil Wheaton.
It's hard to argue with him.
Because he makes no sense? Yeah.
This is actually kind of nice.
You and me getting to spend
a couple days in bed together.
Yeah. Pretty soon, we're gonna have
two crying babies in the house.
I'm glad my balls hurt. It's all their fault.
Well, let's just enjoy this quiet time
while we still got it.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is really quiet.
You think Penny's doing okay?
Penny, everything all right?
Hey, all good. Dipped her pacifier
in a little bourbon, she conked right out.
Hope you're joking.
Of course I'm joking.
I don't share my bourbon.
-She's joking.
-Heh.
Definitely.
Probably.
Wil Wheaton.
Wil Wheaton.
This is Sheldon, by the way.
Hi, Sheldon.
Here, I found this pizza flyer in your fence.
-Thank you.
-Okay, now you owe me a favor.
Turn down the role of Professor Proton.
I don't think so.
You can't be Professor Proton.
You're not a scientist.
Well, I was never on a starship,
but pretending I was bought me this house.
And if I'd pretended a little longer,
it would have a swimming pool.
Some things shouldn't be rebooted.
Some things were perfect the way they were.
Like the walled city of York,
it was a delight, but New York? Blergh.
Did you ever consider
that Arthur would be happy...
...to know that his show has outlived him?
I doubt it. He was kind of a mean, old crank.
Sheldon, I promise that I will work my hardest
to make this show great...
...so that a whole new generation of kids
will grow up and they will be able to say...
...that Professor Proton was the reason
they got into science.
Wow.
That was very persuasive.
Thanks.
But I won't be seduced by your acting skills,
nor your movie-star charisma.
There's only one Professor Proton,
and he had neither of those things.
I'll give you one more chance to bow out.
Or what?
When we first met, we were enemies...
...but we worked through that,
and we became friends.
Do you really wanna go back?
Honestly, it doesn't feel very different.
I'm not leaving.
All right, I'm gonna sic my dog on you.
You don't have a dog.
Yes, I do.
Ugh. I can't tell if you're lying,
you're such a good actor.
Hey, how you doing?
What are you doing here?
Oh, I just came by.
You know, see if you need any help.
-Howard and Bernadette asked you to check.
-That is not entirely true.
So did Leonard, and, well, everybody.
How irresponsible do you all think I am?
We don't think you're irresponsible.
We think you're fun-loving.
That is just a nice word for ""irresponsible.""
Hmm. You might be more on the ball
than we thought.
I'm getting a little hungry.
-Want me to get it this time?
-That'd be great.
[SOUND OF BELL RINGING]
This is fun.
And now you also get to see
an annoyed blond walk into the room.
What?
Can you get us a little snack?
-You sure you don't want your spy to do it?
-What are you talking about?
You don't trust me?
You had to have Amy stop by?
We trust you.
Yeah, you were a terrible waitress,
and we still asked you to get us a snack.
[HALLEY CRYING OVER MONITOR]
Excuse me while I go take care of your baby.
Then I'll bring you your snack
and you can insult me some more.
I don't know about you,
but I am not eating whatever she brings us.
PENNY [OVER MONITOR]:
Hey, Halley.
Oh, it's okay. Auntie Penny's here. Shh.
Let's get you changed.
Your mommy and daddy say they trust me,
but they're full of the same stuff your diaper is.
Now I feel bad.
Well, she never really liked me.
It's kind of nice she hates you now too.
But I'm here for you,
and I would never let anything happen to you...
...because your Auntie Penny
loves you so much.
HALLEY:
Mama.
Was that her first word?
HALLEY:
Mama.
PENNY:
Oh, no, no, baby, I'm not your mama.
Your mama's the nice lady
we're gonna go see right now...
...so I can rub this in her face.
Do you hear that, suckers?
She called me mama.
Hello, Arthur.
You know...
...we could also meet in a deli.
I'm sorry to say that I failed you.
I tried to stop Wil Wheaton
being Professor Proton, but I couldn't.
See, now, that's the kind of thing
you could tell a fella...
...over a pastrami sandwich.
Well, don't worry,
he's now on my enemies list forever.
-He's totally cut off.
-Interesting.
Can anyone sign up for that list?"
